ADHyperlink’D

Do you get it? If not click here.

One wonders if you weren’t so disordered from near infinite detours on your way here if you won’t now be so tempted as to follow a link now thither?

Which, Today, keeping it 100%—as we are almost always encouraged to be—clicking on a link is stone-age’s throw away from anything resounding remotely like a mouse click—something also spring-loaded, the bit of pressure to reminding you of your Navigation Away from the Web page, nothing remotely as liquid, silent-yet-haptic feedback almost as if being rewarded and thereby goaded to click out, or click through, or else just maintain clicking?


John Bradshaw’d say: dis-ease.

(“I see, are the links underlined, merely? going Nowhere… but still giving indications of Activity when pressed so it can’t be they go nowhere? What”)



\> Assuming 3–10% already over this joke/conceit minutes ago, will have realized before the game started they all lead literally <a href=”#here”>.</a>



John Bradshaw was a writer when that was still viable, wrote a lot about addictions, Trauma, but anyway to keep things moving Ugh no, I’m not going for another tired metaphor of dependence re: Tech. Am I right, Lord(e), take us all, lest we bear the burden of that Joke again, g/God(s).



No, I simply wanted to point out his very simple writerly, flourish-y, now dead ways of making words virtually take on life, save lives, even, maybe! Whereas our merely modern word-luvr’s got a quivr stuffed w/ Enchanting Information Linking Elsewhere, whose knowledge is thereby ordained via the shared graphic cues, trafficked in our most rushing hour… letting us know that they’re Citing something and… and probably that thing is better, this article having been so old by the third—most tempting— link (OK quiver’s empty).



How do I know Medium isn’t making some deal with Lexus as I write this (better hurry, text Now) and mb this whole enterprise will have been sponsored by a digital car company, a vehicle digitally “crashing” through, in all the confidence of un-neglected toddlerdom… yes a gas powered engine they’re still tryin! Classic Gold or Sports Silver? Yea: how am I to know? And then, am I the only tab? Window? Program? Device? Medium (swear I did not mean that) headed directly after You, as we read:



And the all new LexuPro i0101 in Sports Silver and Lurid Maroon! ‎‎289.99 ₽ @ 2.3% due-at-always financing, say if you’re Doctor severe or worsening signs of!

Without looking away, or wondering if you are distracted by Capital, nor what that strange currency was—could it’ve been a ruble, yes—are there windows near? Are there Children. If not of age, of soul, maybe (not the spirit-of-Lexus, c’est-à-dire)? Are certain notifications snoozing (endlessly Working they are!) but during these last 3–5 minutes, the Pulse of their Activity were signified through a layer of fabric in pants pocket? Maybe you’re not sitting at a desktop at all, it has struck me too late (ego-Centrum)!



Yes, the thing must literally have beckoned your return from the very thing which calls it to visible existence, and you most mornings! If not physically than by vibrations subtly increasing, respective Whirrs traveling (in waves as Sounds are wont) through “me” (written—and read I’m sure—with a roll of the eyes), and finally, somewhere into you, eliciting some chemical reaction worn deep in your Lizard Pleasure center of Mysterious ab-original Motives, on the brain’s scene when Humans were meant to have shirked jet-skis and orthodontia… this blissed out bombardment, whatever they had then, unchanged, there’s where the phone and links have been At Play… the rut so technically exploited producing the most telling signs of life these days, Drive, yes such a response has been growing more Robust all the while, this meagre olympiad of 7 estimated minutes a feat for us both, and so has that rut been exploited in tandem with precisely Everyone Else, ~10 years for many, at best worn down to a tattered neuronal net, 1 cell-wall thick in places, no more capable of stopping a—



Probably lost you, surely almost every-body when it veered down toward poetry (where else?) in the end, and now sideways “across” “the” “page(s)” “…”

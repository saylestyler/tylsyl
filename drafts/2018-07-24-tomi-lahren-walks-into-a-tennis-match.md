3 women*, 1 “man”.

helicopter view of the stadium overhead and the voice literally echoing soundwaves amplified by the songstress’ passion (+ electricity ofc) for Music and its Mysteries and 2 MegaSubWoofers.

malodorous molecules act as a chemical stimulus (molecules bind odor–voltatilized chemical compounds in very low concentrations)

“OH SAY CAN YOU SEE?”

(A querying SEE? as opossed to the very sedated “see….?” of lesser amateur sporting events, a wish that this was plus <em><strong>the Daytona 1,500</strong></em> and this was Patti LaBelle’s honor to be “singing” the national anthem in front of over 65,000 attendees and the 5th division air squadrant-quad whom, toward the begininng final verse, was to fly an \_F-16 RAPTOR-A-class\_ over the stadium, staying well below the airspace of the helicopter which was also recording the the stadium, Ms. LaBelle’s voice issuing from it as if it could be heard above the sound of propeller wash) with approximately all of the people in attendance are talking? Some of the seniors had raised their vietnam vet ultrasoft quasi-trucker baseball-(nascar?)-hats to their hearts and some are “”homeless vets“”)

BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT. "Don’t know why <em>she's</em> singing in this day and age can't say anything" "Yeup but then again there's black soilders umong them than white Terry + choir ofc." "wannaseethemFighterJets is all—they have their own ntnl anthm did u know? \*\*TERRI\*\*"

(*DAWN did always feel _AWFUL_ tickled when she heard her name in OUR National Anthem {!}… of course part of the tickling was her borderline fascination w/ the smell of detergents… Not even into cleaning either, they could afford to have “a cleaning lady”… and maybe that was it? Maybe she punished herself, fiercely sniffing the soaps—because of Lupe (Lupé? Lúpe? Łupe? worked into a panic now, vitale detailye?)—how she couldn’t really critique her cleaning but was left feeling as though she… she sometimes smelled the caustic soaps beneath the sink—Lupe’s area—which… hate to say it but Kelly Osborne was right…. Dawn stayed out of politics… but Lupe, said she’s moving back “of her own accord” (verbatim), looked happy…

Bill is looking happy too, the CREEP

WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HAILED\*\* Mz. Labelle hailing from an Upscale Neighborhood (whose gates were mainly for show, being plastic) in Pennsylvania… had been driven in one stretch in an air-conditioned caddliac pseudo-stretch limousine… much like those in which the Armed Forces had been ushered

AT THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GUhhhhLEahMiNg, great book, temperature currently 96.8F with about 110% humedyti $897,000 worth of Long-neck Budwisers had already been purchased compared $17,500 in Corona perhaps due to the primary nationality & allegiencas of the folks here

AND THE ROCKET’S RE-HEAD GL-HAIR here the crowd against their will let out a collective gasp, number in the millions lbs.sq.in PSI and the sheer ancient quality of The Voice which had appeared, ghastlily, center stage… the gasp was accompanied by the and an! a! simultaneous effort to locate from where the CANTATRICE was located, as if she had moved, cameras r forgotten in pockets,

*and so apparently Satan’s ostensibly lead choirboygirl had appearead this Floridian “DAWN DISH”… But no, it was still Patti LaBelle, who had paused to both catch her breath after before THE BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR

yep the daughter (wrist located w/ binoculars cross-stadium from nose-bleed) is wearing a charm bracelet but is “anything but charming, doubtless, disgusting if u ask me”

& lest only everyone forget completely the choir who now come in only on last few notes (“magical…”)

& due to it being overcast one can’t even see the F-16 RAPTOR-A-class Fighter Jets or it’s that they’re Breaking The Sound Barrier & moving faster than the Human Eye could see followed by a Ghastly Awesome Hush on the Court

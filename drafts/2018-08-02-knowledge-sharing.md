mojligheten for mig att lara programmering ar en privileg som jag kan antingen
  - anvanda passivt for att bara "forleva"
  - anvand aktivt for vissa mal (sjalvligt)
  - anvanda, tillaga till, iterera, om igen, for storare mal
  - anvanda som radikalt (dvs moralistisk/"altrusistiskt") verktyg genom att givande "ner" den for forhoppningsvis forbattra liven av andra

Onwards. And so onwards along the path of wisdom, with a hearty tread, a hearty
confidence! However you may be, be your own source of experience! Throw off
your discontent about your nature; forgive yourself your own self, for you have
in it a ladder with a hundred rungs, on which you can climb to knowledge. The
age into which you feel yourself thrown with sorrow calls you blessed because
of this stroke of fortune; it calls to you so that you may share in experiences
that men of a later time will perhaps have to forego. Do not disdain having
once been religious; investigate thoroughly how you once had a genuine access
to art. Do not these very experiences help you to pursue with greater
understanding enormous stretches of earlier humanity? Have not many of the most
splendid fruits of older culture grown up on that very ground that sometimes
displeases you, on the ground of impure thinking? One must have loved religion
and art like one's mother or wet-nurse-otherwise one cannot become wise. But
one must be able to look beyond them, outgrow them; if one stays under their
spell, one does not understand them. Likewise, you must be familiar with
history and the delicate game with the two scales: "on the one hand-on the
other hand." Stroll backwards, treading in the footprints in which humanity
made its great and sorrowful passage through the desert of the past; then you
have been instructed most surely about the places where all later humanity
cannot or may not go again. And by wanting with all your strength to detect in
advance how the knot of the future will be tied, your own life takes on the
value of a tool and means to knowledge. You have it in your power to merge
everything you have lived through-attempts, false starts, errors, delusions,
passions, your love and your hope-into your goal, with nothing left over: you
are to become an inevitable chain of culture-rings, and on the basis of this
inevitability, to deduce the inevitable course of culture in general. When your
sight has become good enough to see the bottom in the dark well of your being
and knowing, you may also see in its mirror the distant constellations of
future cultures. Do you think this kind of life with this kind of goal is too
arduous, too bereft of all comforts? Then you have not yet learned that no
honey is sweeter than that of knowledge, and that the hanging clouds of sadness
must serve you as an udder, from which you will squeeze the milk to refresh
yourself. Only when you are older will you perceive properly how you listened
to the voice of nature, that nature which rules the whole world through
pleasure. The same life that comes to a peak in old age also comes to a peak in
wisdom, in that gentle sunshine of continual spiritual joyfulness; you
encounter both old age and wisdom on one ridge of life-that is how nature
wanted it. Then it is time, and no cause for anger that the fog of death is
approaching. Towards the light-your last movement; a joyful shout of
knowledge-your last sound.

It was late winter in Gordita, though for sure not the usual weather. You heard people muttering to the effect that last summer the beach didn&rsquo;t have summer till August, and now there probably wouldn&rsquo;t be any winter till spring. Santa Anas had been blowing all the smog out of downtown L.A., funneling between Hollywood and Puente Hills on westward through Gordita Beach and out to sea, and this had been going on for what seemed like weeks now. Offshore winds had been too strong to be doing the surf much good, but surfers found themselves getting up early anyway to watch the dawn weirdness, which seemed like a visible counterpart to the feeling in everybody&rsquo;s skin of desert winds and heat and restlessness, with the exhaust for millions of motor vehicles mixing with microfine Mojave sand to refract the light toward the bloody end of the spectrum, everything dim, lurid, and biblical, sailor-take-warning skies. The state liquor stamps over the tops of tequila bottles in the stores were coming unstuck, is how dry the air was. Liquor-store owners could be filling those bottles with anything anymore. Jets were taking off the wrong way from the airport, the engine sounds were not passing across the sky where they should have , so everybody&rsquo;s dreams got disarranged, when people could get to sleep at all. In the little apartment complexes the wind entered narrowing to whistle through the stairwells and ramps and catwalks, and the leaves of the palm trees outside rattled together with a liquid sound, so that from inside, in the darkened rooms, in louvered light, it sounded like a rainstorm the wind raging in the concrete geometry, the palms beating together like the rush of a tropical downpour, enough to get you to open the door and look outside, and of course there&rsquo;d only be the same hot cloudless depth of day, no rain in sight. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last few weeks now, St. Flip of Lawndale, for whom Jesus Christ was not only personal savior but surfing consultant as well, who rode an old-school redwood plank running just under ten feet with an inlaid mother-of-pearl cross on top and two plastic skegs of a violent pink color on the bottom, had been hitching rides from a &nbsp;friend with a little fiberglass runabout far out into the Outside, to surf what he swore was the gnarliest break in the world, with waves bigger than Waimea, bigger than Maverick&rsquo;s up the coast of Half Moon Bay. Stewardii on transpacific flights making their final approaches into LAX reported seeing him below, surfing where no surf should&rsquo;ve been, a figure in white baggy tunes, whiter than the prevailing light could really account for&hellip; In the evenings with sunset behind him, he would ascend again to the secular groove of honky-tonk Gordita Beach and grab a beer and silently hang out and smile at people when he had to, and wait for first light to return. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in his beach pad there was a velvet painting of Jesus riding goofyfoot on a rough-hewn board with outriggers, meant to suggest a crucifix, through surf seldom observed on the Sea of Galilee, though this hardly presented a challenge to Flip&rsquo;s faith. What was &ldquo;walking on water,&rdquo; if it wasn&rsquo;t Bible talk for surfing? In Australia once, a local surfer, holding the biggest can of beer Flip had ever seen, had even sold him a fragment of the True Board. </span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c0">Over the years Doc had known a surfer or two who&rsquo;d found and ridden other breaks located far form shore that nobody else had the equipment either under their feet or the hearts to ride, who&rsquo;d gone alone every dawn, often for years, shadows cast out over the water, to be taken, unphotographed and unrecorded, on rides of five minutes and longer through seething tunnels of solar bluegreen, the true and unendurable color of daylight. Doc had noticed that after a while these folks would no longer be quite where their friends expected to find them. Long-standing tabs at front-roofed beer bars had to be forgiven, shoreside honeys were left to gaze mournfully at the horizons and eventually to take up with civilians from over the berm, claim adjusters, vice principals, </span><span class="c0">security</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;guards, and so forth even though rent on the abandoned surfer pads still got paid somehow and mysterious lights kept appearing through the windows long after the honky-tonks had closed for the night, and the people who thought they&rsquo;d actually seen these absent surfers later admitted they might have been hallucinating after all. </span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;I think they just go out and drink beer and come back when it gets dark,&rdquo; opined ZigZag Twong, who had switched last year to a shorter board and more forgiving waves. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensenada Slim shook his head gravely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too many stories about that break.

Customers at tables leaned toward one another and then away, in slow rhythms, like plants underwater. House regulars drank shots of hot sake, chased with house champagne.

Profane was afraid of land or seascapes like this, where nothing else lived but himself. It seemed he was always walking into one: turn a corner in the street, open a door to a weather-deck and there he&rsquo;d be, in alien country. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c13">Yowl very noir n stuff but yowl </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow fell in tiny glittering pinpoints, the alley held its own curious snow light: turning Pig to black-and-white clown&rsquo;s motley and ancient brick walls, dusted with snow, to neutral gray. Pig had on a knitted watch cap, pulled down over his face tot he neck so that his head showed up as a sphere of dead black. Engine exhaust roiled in clouds around him. Profane shivered. &ldquo;What are you doing, Pig,&rdquo; he called. Pig didn&rsquo;t answer. The enigma or sinister version of Pig and that Harley-Davidson alone in an alley at three in the morning reminded Profane too suddenly of Rachel, whom he didn&rsquo;t want to think about, not tonight in the bitter cold, with a headache, with snow slipping into the room. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew no more than that he was a Zionist, suffered, was confused, was daft to stand rooted sock-top deep in the loam of any kibbutz, a hemisphere away. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profane had wondered then what it was with Da Conho and that machine gun. Love for an object, this was new to him. When he found out not long after this that the same thing was with Rachel and her MG, he had his first intelligence that something had been going on under the rose, maybe for longer and with more people than he would care to think about. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c13">YOWL these two paragraphs YOWZA </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also: to know that Pynchon grew up in Long Island and how he&rsquo;s writing about how terrible it is within 19 pages&hellip; but one doesn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c13 c9">know </span><span class="c1 c13">that he grew up there if they didn&rsquo;t read about it, because he has an eye for Everywhere&hellip; and it seems like he&rsquo;s just commenting on &ldquo;some other place&rdquo; and not a place where he has strong emotional connections&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Rachel came from the Five Towns on the south shore of Long Island, an area comprising Malvern, Lawrence, Cedarhurst, Hewlett and Woodmere and sometimes Long Beach and Atlantic Beach, though no one has ever thought of calling it the Seven Towns. Though the inhabitants are not Sephardim, the area seems afflicted with a kind of geographical incest. Daughters are constrained to pace demure and darkeyed like so many Rapunzels within he magic frontiers of a country where the elfin architecture of Chinese restaurants, seafood palaces and split-level synagogues is often enchanting as the sea; until they have ripened enough to be sent off to the mountains and colleges of the Northeast. Not to hunt husbands (for a certain parity has always obtained in the Five Towns whereby a nice boy can be predestined for husband as early as age sixteen or seventeen); but to be granted the illusion at least of having &ldquo;played the field&rdquo;&mdash;so necessary to a girl&rsquo;s emotional development. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the brave escape. Come Sunday nights, with golfing done, the Negro maids, having rectified the disorder of last night&rsquo;s party, off to visit with relatives in Lawrence, and Ed Sullivan still hours away, the blood of this kingdom exit from their enormous homes, enter their automobiles and proceed to the business districts. There to divert themselves among seemingly endless vistas of butterfly shrimp and egg foo young; Orientals bow, and smile, and flutter through summer&rsquo;s twilight, and in their voices are the birds of summer. And with night&rsquo;s fall comes a brief promenade in the street: the torsos of the father solid and sure in its J. Press suit; the eyes of the daughters secret behind sunglasses rimmed in rhinestones. And as the jaguar has given its name to the mother&rsquo;s car, so has it given its skin-pattern to the slacks which compass her sleek hips. Who could escape? Who could want to? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c13">thinking: when I&rsquo;m interview later in life about my background etc. how it might say &ldquo;You worked for Visionaire what did you do before that?&rdquo; and how I would say &ldquo;Well I waited tables for a long time which was great for the money but which really forced me to like, step my game up, to escape, because it&rsquo;s a nightmare after 4 years, which I did it for 6&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span class="c13 c9">but you must believe that to be true? how could it not be? you could never persist in staying there until you&rsquo;re 30? of course not! you&rsquo;re going to get visionaire and if not them then somewhere else and then somewhere else and then get hired&hellip; and not having a university education doesn&rsquo;t mean shit if you show what you got, which, </span><span class="c0 c12 c9">YA GOT IT. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c13">thinking: maybe it&rsquo;s not a good idea that I let people know that I was born in a trailer park because it would get behind the illusion that i&rsquo;m this cultured genius &mdash; but then, when you are firmly in a position of power, </span><span class="c13 c9">do let them know</span><span class="c1 c13">! because it will then reveal the true nature of power, which is self-made (sometimes)&hellip; and that being born privileged does not confer wealth of experience and knowledge usually, because it&rsquo;s usually, in the U.S. just more tourist going to Florida and Myrtle Beach which, whatever?

Shiny and black, sewn into the flesh, was a miniature electric switch. Single-pole, double-throw. Walter recoiled and stood blinking. Thin silver wires ran from its terminals up the arm, disappearing under the sleeve. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You see, Mildred.

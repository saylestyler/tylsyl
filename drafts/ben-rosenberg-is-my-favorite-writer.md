## Unpopular Gay Opinions

_July 24, 2018_

while we are in the zone of posting potentially (but maybe not entirely) unpopular gay opinions, i'm gonna just be entirely petty and say this:

it is not an uncommon thing at all to encounter queer and trans people who

a) come from means, and whose sexuality or gender expression, while perhaps disturbing to their families, has not ultimately proven to be grounds for their disentitlement to that support network

AND / OR

b) are stably employed and making considerably more than a living wage

...who choose to promote amateur craft projects and cottage industries as their own personal brand of for-profit community. it is also not at all uncommon to find working class and poor queer and trans people without familial wealth or, perhaps, any viable family network, who treat these specific types of hacks as aspirational, and who will scrounge together coins to buy their way into a community and a sense of belonging.

if it didn't go without saying, i don't fuck with the former subset AT ALL, and will specifically dead my relationship with someone over that type of behavior. i do so because this practice is different, and emergent from a different mindset entirely, than simply being paid for your labor or being an artist or other worker vying for institutional support. if the only realistic claim you have to your performance of 'marginalised' identity is the people you've tokenised in return for free or discounted access to your 'community' and good graces (because who would you really be without their cosign),_ and if in fact the basis of your community isn't much more than people investing in each others' subpar, mediocre products in vague attempts at legitimacy, and splurging on leisure activities and pleasure cruises as 'self-care' together while having vague conversations about oppression and the cisheteropatriarchy, sorry not sorry but you are a fucking FRAUD, miss thing,_ and your actions are disgusting.

all respect to folks living without and doing what they need to get the support / resources / access they can, but like if anyone didn't clock by now, friends don't make friends pay for their love. they don't use anxiety or past trauma as constant excuses to be fickle and fly-by-night. they show up even when it isn't comfortable, convenient, glamorous, or popular. most communities are ultimately exclusionary long cons, but if the people closest to you are lowkey shaming you into funding their side hustle under the guise of having a punk ethos, news flash \*you might need new friends\*.

tl:dr if your friends are actually punks, their relationship to you prolly won't center around consumerism. fite me

xxxo,

the girl who gave up acquaintances for ride or dies and real ones only (years too late, but long enough ago to know better) ❤❤❤

## prescient straws

_July 24, 2018 (and another one)_

today, in 'is she grasping at straws, or is this actually quite prescient?':

at this point, trans shit on a social level is like the tech bubble: some ppl will have grown up with its products and vernacular, some will not. and this phenomenon will be violently deployed not only as a generational schism but as a class-based benchmark for competency, designating who is allowed access to jobs, resources, informal communication networks, etc. we may look at this as a positive in the present tense, while news of gender-based murders and bias are still high in the headlines, but i believe looking forward, history would indicate that long after media coverage of this violence has ceased to garner attention (read: profit), the incidents themselves will continue. we will see (and are, in all honesty, already seeing) the emergence of a media-savvy progressive elite whose embodiment has been deemed palatable to mainstream society and who thereby are granted authority in the formulation of popular rhetoric around gender issues and etiquette. this etiquette will fail, ultimately, to account for the material needs of the larger underclass of gender nonconforming and trans people aside from occasional token representation and pet charity projects. people living 'below the poverty line' will still be targeted, denied healthcare and basic survival needs, and the new rhetoric will change neither these circumstances nor their economic underpinnings. **much like the convenient distance of americans unduly crediting twitter and mobile technology for their role in the arab spring, civility and representation will continue to be used as a salve for material contradictions. denizens of, for lack of a better terminology, the straight world (now expanded to include pansexuality, polyamory, nonsurgical nonbinary identity by alternate consumer means, et. al) will be allowed to congratulate themselves on their use of vocabulary and theory in the comfort of a diffuse default sequestration from marginalisation. as this now disembodied knowledge crawls its way up the supply chain from commons to cultural imaginary and academia to corporate ownership, ever in a toxic feedback loop with a multivariably disenfranchised consumer base, the suffering and trauma that were once urgent imperatives for action become price points and sales pitches. disconnection becomes a refusal to connect. who will be the ajit pai of trans politicking?** what ends do your current appeals for means actually feed? and for all their fetishising of posthumanism and biohacking, when will trans and tech proselytisers alike begin to logistically account for the fact that their very political foundations stand to be undone by their oversight and consequent exploitation of utterly human vulnerabilities?

## Rage Against the Rage

_July 22, 2018_

an important trick is to not let all you know of the world turn to anger. or, at least, to cultivate a capacity to transmute your anger into something useful. rage alone is not enough.

## POINTLESS ABJECTION

_June 29, 2018_

wait, so...the people protesting in the hart atrium all wore their own mylar blankets? yawl. props for showing up for sure, but can we get over this overidentification thing? wearing someone's suffering as a costume is really not imperative to make a point or effectively protest, i promise. tbh that shit is od disgusting, like ok you took the day off work or used your disposable income to book travel and show up, live in that truth. you can be as you are and still give a shit about what's going on around you. it's bad enough that all this ephemera just gets trashed afterwards and creates mad waste, like what message are u rly sending?? clearly no one in power gives a fuck about the level of pain they're causing, why give this overaffected schtick like you're also soooo disempowered? what if this crowd of hundreds of (predominantly white, probably upper middle class) people showed up like LOOK. we're political contributors, we're the voting base, we're among the higher tax brackets, some of our children are in ivies and will inevitably be your doctors, lawyers, coworkers some day, and u not about to pull this shit on american soil?? like y'all know i'm on that fuck america shit all gd day but **STRATEGY. TACTICS. COME ON. i really can't stress enough: if you have means, connections, resources, access, STOP FEELING GUILTY ABOUT IT AND PERFORMING THIS POINTLESS ABJECTION. STAND IN YOUR POWER IN CONSTRUCTIVE (OR BENEFICIALLY DESTRUCTIVE) WAYS. no one needs another meaningless victim, especially if the victim was a fraud who chose not to use what power they had to get shit done.** i'm sleep, gnite  😑

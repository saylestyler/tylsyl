73 3mo  If you want to move forward, if you want to heal, awaken, activate, connect, and express your full human potential, you can’t lie, to yourself, or others. If you want to move forward, you have to face the truth, no matter what that happens to be.  If you were traumatized by toxic parents as a child, you are going to have to face that      0.53
        truth so you can mend and heal. If you are a toxic parent, you are going to have to face that truth so you can heal yourself and help your kids. If you’re an addict, you’re going to have to face that so you can stop distracting and avoiding. If you’re a callous bully, hurting from an extremely toxic childhood, you’re going to have to face
        that as well. If you want to move forward, then you are going to have to face whatever it is you are hiding from yourself.

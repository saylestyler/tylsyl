Was watching this thought I'd summarize some of the points made :) 

> FOXP2 Gene 

A gene heavily tied to language production... abnormalities in people with certain syndromes of diminished vocabularies. In mice with the gene removed they make a lot less sounds. When the human version of the gene is spliced into the mice, they make a lot more sounds.

> Pidgin -> Creole

When populations are forced to live together but speak diff languages (think forced labor) pidgins develop to allow them to communicate. Pidgins have very simple grammar rules. A generation later, creoles develop with complex grammar. 

The grammar of creoles is as complex as any language. 

Meaning that even though they are developed in isolation, they do not feature the least common denom / easiest syntaxes. 

> Nicaraguan Sign Language

Developed in isolation among deaf children in Nicaragua (pidgin) ended up featuring (creole) the same grammatical features of creole languages, which is to say, of major languages. 

This implies that there is a genetic, hard wired neurological basis for grammar (think/cf Chomsky).

> Greater Ecological Diversity = Greater Grammar Complexity 

Languages that develop in diverse ecosystems feature more complex ways of constructing sentences (objects, participles, tenses) than those that do not. 

> Schizophrenia Is a Language Disorder

The primary symptoms of schizophrenia are misunderstood because of cinematic misinfo, "schizo" to refer to chaotic behavior, or the most florid feature of the disease, hallucinations.

The primary symptom of all _types_ of schizophrenia (paranoid, catatonic, delusional) is the inability to string together sequential thoughts. 

Another is the inability to think in the abstract. e.g. 

Q: What do apples, oranges and bananas have in common?
 
A: They're all multisyllabic words. 

(Or in paranoid schizophrenia, 
A: They're all wired for listening. A world that makes no sense is extremely threatening) 

> Neurochemistry of Hallucinations 

The final defining feature is hallucinations. 

But note: almost all of them are auditory... and while you would expect that they would be random, fragmented sounds they're *structured*. 

They're so structured that papers have been published defining the most common of voices heard, which in Western countries are: 

1. Jesus 
2. Satan 
3. Head of State at the time

tldr Structure.

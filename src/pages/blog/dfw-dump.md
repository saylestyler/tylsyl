Takeway: self-help books sure do make you Question your Mom

That’s just the thing about recognizing our common humanity, our common burden. We’re suspended for a moment on this spinning blue pearl, here together and alive right now, conscious, though no one knows why. It is a question of caring. When one of us considers the experiences of another, all the failings and the achievements in someone else’s life, we are seeing from this common place, knowing that it’s all taking place in doubt and the absolute solitude and terror of being human, and knowing that it’s all temporary. All those who are unsure of themselves and suspect themselves of the worst falseness and wrong, bad things are to be not only pitied but loved, identified with and known. Wallace taught that, and suffered for it, and in a way he died of it, too.

the most efficacious objects for substitute gratification are a parent’s own children.

The categorical denial of the pain we suffered at the beginning of our lives is harmful in the extreme. Suppose someone setting out on a long walk sprains an ankle right at the outset. That person may decide to ignore the pain and to soldier on because he/she has been looking forward to the outing, but sooner or later others will notice that they are limping and will ask what has happened. When they hear the whole story they will understand why this person is limping and advise him/her to go for treatment. But in connection with the sufferings of childhood, which play a similar role in our lives to a sprained ankle at the beginning of a long hike, then things are different. Those sufferings cannot be “played down,” they will leave their mark on the whole enterprise. The crucial difference in this case is that normally no one will take any notice. The whole of society is, as it were, in unison with the sufferer, who cannot say what has happened. It may well be that, despite the violation of their integrity, people who have been injured in this way really have no memories. If they have to spend their whole lives with people who play down the traumas of childhood, then they have no choice but to connive in this self-delusion. Their lives will progress in much the same way as the outing of the hiker who has sprained his ankle but pretends that nothing has happened. Should they, however, encounter people who know about the long-term effects of childhood traumas, then they will have the chance to abandon their denial and good prospects of healing the wounds they have been carrying around with them.

Most people are not so fortunate. The celebrities among them are surrounded by hosts of unsuspecting admirers, none of whom recognize the distress afflicting the stars they idolize. This is in fact the last thing they want to know about. Examples are legion. We may recall the fate of the enchanting Marilyn Monroe, who was put in a home by her mother, was raped at the age of nine, and was sexually harassed by her stepfather when she returned to her family. Right to the end she trusted in her charm, and finally she was killed by depression and drugs. Her own account of her childhood is frequently quoted on the internet:

“I was not an orphan. An orphan has no parents. All the other children in the orphanage had lost their parents. I still had a mother. But she didn’t want me. I was ashamed to explain this to the other children…”

Some may wish for similar success in their lives and cannot understand why celebrities cannot simply enjoy their stardom. If a person is especially gifted, they can use that gift to reinforce the refusal of the truth and keep it away from themselves and others.
s. The readiness to attack them for violating this social taboo has to do with the fact that the violation of that taboo is a source of major alarm for others too. These people will sometimes mobilize all the forces at their command to discredit the former victim and thus keep their own repressions intact.

The lives (and deaths) of all these successful stars indicate that depression is not a form of suffering that relates to the present, which after all has bestowed on them the fulfillment of all their dreams. Instead it is the suffering caused by the separation from one’s own self, abandoned early on, never mourned for, and accordingly doomed to despair and death. It is as if the body used depression as a form of protest against this self-betrayal, against the lies and the dissociation of genuine feelings, because authentic feelings are something it cannot live without. It needs the free flow of emotions in constant flux: rage, grief, joy. If these are blocked by denial the body cannot function normally.

People resort to all kinds of “remedies” to compel the body to function normally all the same: drugs, alcohol, nicotine, tablets, immersion in work. It is an attempt to avoid understanding the revolt of the body, to prevent ourselves from experiencing the fact that feelings will not kill us but, on the contrary, can free us from the prison we call depression. Depression may reassert itself once we revert to ignoring our feelings and needs, but in time we can learn to deal with it more effectively. As our feelings tell us what happened to us in childhood, we can learn to understand them, we no longer need to fear them as we did before, the anxiety recedes, and we are better equipped to face the next depressive phase. But we can only admit those feelings if we no longer fear our internalized parents.

The assumption I proceed from is this: for most people the idea that they were not loved by their parents is unbearable. The more evidence there is for this deprivation, the more strongly these people cling to the illusion of having been loved. They also cling to their feelings of guilt, which provide misleading confirmation that if their parents did not treat them lovingly then it was all their own fault, the fault of their mistakes and failings. Depression is the body’s rebellion against this lie. Many people would prefer to die (either literally or symbolically by killing off their feelings), rather than experience the helplessness of the little child exploited by the parents for their own ambitions or used as a projection screen for their pent-up feelings of hatred.
In the book I trace this phenomenon back to the childhood histories of those who elect to go in for this line of work and indicate that they were forced at a very early stage to feel the distress of their mothers and fathers, to empathize with it, and to abandon their own feelings and needs in the process. Depression is the price the adult pays for this early self-abandonment. These are people who have always asked themselves what others need from them, thus not only neglecting their own feelings and needs, but never even making contact with them. But the body is aware of them and insists that the individual should be allowed to live out his/her authentic feelings and to claim the right to express them. This is anything but easy for people who in infancy were used exclusively to satisfy the needs of their parents.
If I allow myself to feel what pains or gladdens me, what annoys or enrages me, and why this is the case, if I know what I need and what I do not want at all costs, then I will know myself well enough to love my life and find it interesting, regardless of age or social status. Then I will hardly feel the need to terminate my life, unless the process of aging and the increasing frailty of the body should set off such thoughts in me. But even then I will know that I have lived my own, true life.
We cannot resolve the effects of mistreatment in therapies that evade the facts and confine themselves only to the analysis of the psychic realities. But we can liberate ourselves from the consequences if we are prepared to face emotionally the truth of our childhood, to give up the denial of our suffering, to develop empathy for the child that we were and to thus understand the reasons for our fears. In this way, we free ourselves from the fears and guilt feelings that were burdened upon us from the earliest age. Through the knowledge of our history and our feelings, we get to know the persons that we are, and we learn to give to them what they vitally need but never received from their parents: love and respect. This is the goal of the uncovering therapy: The wounds can be scared over if they are tended to and taken seriously; but the existence of the scars should not be denied.

    _____________________________

    “Display vulnerability and ask her to evaluate the like integrity of your heart. Seem desperate. Your whole married self-concept shaken. Practically beg the Subject to reassure you you're not a bad-hearted man. Plead with the Subject to say what she thinks it might be about her charms that could drive your serapic wife even momentarily from your heart. You present the attraction you feel for the Subject as this involuntary identity-threatening soul-searing-type crisis you just desperately need her help with, the Subject's, person to person”


    “Some of the more marginal players start in as early as maybe twelve, I'm sorry to say, particularly 'drines before matches and then enkephaline2626after, which can generate a whole vicious circle of individual neurochemis-try; but I myself, having taken certain vows early on concerning fathers and differences, didn't even get downwind of my first bit of Bob Hope2727 until fifteen, more like nearly sixteen, when Bridget Boone, in whose room a lot of the 16 and Unders used to congregate before lights-out, invited me to consider a couple of late-night bongs, as a kind of psychodysleptic Sominex, to help me sleep, perhaps, finally, all the way through a really unpleasant dream that had been recurring nightly and waking me up in medias for weeks and was beginning to grind me down and to cause some slight deterioration in performance and rank. Low-grade synthetic Bob or not, the bongs worked like a charm.”

    “At the very worst, someone kind had always found him charming, if things got dire enough to have to rent out his charms. Alas thus about the fact that his charms were now at low ebb. He weighed fifty kilos and his skin was the color of summer squash.”

“omniscient hipster narrative” “DFW a ‘fictioneer’ and ‘wild-card savant’”
Details, details -- but it is sometimes by way of details and their transformation that we understand a bit more about the alchemist's retort that is the writer's imagination.
Getting the novel is not the point and that’s also the point: that there is not a gettable part of reality, not a clear Big Picture
  Wallace is scrabbling along the high-terrain paths earlier explored by Thomas Pynchon and William Gaddis. Indeed, not only does he share with both a mordantly black view of modern and late-modern experience, but he also has a penchant for weaving long braids from enticingly antiphonal plots, each of which is differently absorbing, if not for its characterizations or imaginative brio then for the sharp snap of its thought, the obsessiveness of its informational reference (hence the notes), or -- and -- the incandescence of the writing.
  Ij a great clattering vehicle powered by a rudimentary three stroke engine (narrative)
Gately, like his housemates, is at once sick and arrestingly vulnerable -- and more human than the competitive automatons being groomed at nearby ETA. (yes: the whole last part almost a showing-dichotomy of how it’s more interesting to read about his very human-ness rather than automaton hal)
  think pynchon, think beckett, think gaddis. think.
  He is carrying on the Pynchonian celebration of the renegade spirit in a world gone as flat as a circuit board.


  look at that fucking picture of Zola! a French writer
  I want a fucking picture of Tyler Sayles looking amazing and “an American writer”


  response to grammar pedants:
  It would be gratifying, but ultimately fruitless, to fire back a tart response at every Tom, Dick, and Sally who wants to lord their superior knowledge over me.
  scary that more anglophiles don’t enjoy language--it’s higher use is mocked and anyone using a register of any sort is seen as elitist or pretentious--people seem to find pleasure in dance, music--anything but langauge
  the only people engaging in a discussion about language are doing it in a haught way though… none of the less and fewer supermarket chains are of importance though… do they use langauge to excite, tease, tickle and froth those they talk to? Do they? They’re no more the guardians of language than the kennel club is gaurdian to dogkind.

  in place of art as an ideal we have art as an idol

  Nabokov believed that humanity’s highest yearning ought to be to leave behind any desire to be up-to-date, to be unconcerned with what is happening now. As he put it in his notes to Pale Fire: “Time without consciousness—lower animal world; time with consciousness—man; consciousness without time—some still higher state.”

  callow: inexperienced and immature
  doltish: stupid, idiotic
  pedant: excessively concerned with minor details; perfectionist; displaying academic learning

  two thoughts that r kind of connected: that
1. what’s really actually remarkable wrt hilary and i wrt to our similar histories is that i have done all this sans université… (+ also it’s not like once my dad died i had a rich dad in clarkston to go to…)
  2. that it’s always werid better to humbly posit yourself below an imagined “everyone else within a field” and just keep dilligently working because if not then you can think that you have already done enough--same type of thinking with telling people abt. what you’re going to do and then not actually doing it--
  egotism & willing & réusssiant intimately connected
  3. furthermore when you came to NYC you were and are still true! because you came here knowing no one and still yet you made it and look at your friends (!!! camilla, gewet, maja, patric…) seriously! so fuck those basic detroit bitches



  [denying global warming] This, of course, is a convenient theology that self-servingly rationalizes a narcissistic aversion to any kind of sacrifice or lifestyle change.

  DELEUZE
  Deleuze offers a way out of the binary logic of Freudianism instead desire freed in the form of schizophrenia
  Freudian psychoanalysis sees schizophrenia as a condition in which the libidinal energy is detached from objects, causing the subject to lose his grip on reality, and resulting in incoherent speech, confused action and anxiety. For Deleuze, on the other hand, the hallucinations of the schizophrenic are not a poor image of reality, but are in fact the creative productions of a new reality, in which desire is not repressed by the standard social structures.
  in which he interviews himself in a multitude of guises. It’s possibly the most postmodern pop-culture interview ever recorded. The point here is that rather than being a kind of coping mechanism, Byrne’s multiple personalities are a form of positive action, in which his desire escapes from the confines of a singular identity.
  The schizophrenic’s tendency to break up the body into partial objects is also reflected in Byrne’s desire to “write a song about hair-dos, not about the people under them” because then, “the dos have a power by themselves.”
  metamorphosis and opposed to metaphor
gregor samsa actually BECOMES an insect (not just metaphorically)
  Deleuze: since Plato we’ve been trapped in thinking about representations and referents to other ideas when in truth there is only the real imminent reality in which we live and no outside…
  psychoanalysis thought that all desire was created from a lack--Deleuze thinks that not all desire is so and that some of it is for a positive solid action “desiring-production” = desire is a creative machine; desire is an autonomous force, freed from its subject and object.
  desire is a machine which creates reality by forming assemblages of component parts. Assemblages can be formed by connecting heterogeneous objects and partial objects like the mother’s breast and the child’s mouth, or a wasp and an orchid. The ‘machines of love’ in the Talking Heads song are described as functioning like a Deleuzean assemblage, connecting a long list of interrelated elements: “Smokey water; air conditioned; boys ‘n’ girls; and automation; chromosomes; designer jeans; chimpanzees; and human beings.”
  Artistic creativity works by generating new affects and percepts and then combining them into blocs of sensation. These blocs then form the basis of our experienced reality.  In his book “Bicycle Diaries,” Byrne helps us to understand what this might mean in practice when he describes his own artistic process as “a machine that digs down and finds stuff, emotional stuff that will someday be raw material that can be used to produce more stuff.”
  language is not a representation of the world but part of the fabric of reality and therefore our use of it is political. the primary function then of langauge is not of communication but rather of ORDER le mot d’ordre. language is not made to be believed
  This process is historically defined and can be disturbed by a use of language which problematizes the expected use of words and concepts.
  historic perceptions of the way that language has been used for control
  combat the fear that bureacracy takes over by using language outside of its EXPECTED USE
  immanence: indwelling, inherent
  For Deleuze, there is no metaphysical gap between the signifier and that which it signifies, and thus a word or proposition cannot be given meaning by anything outside of it.
  In reaction to this, Deleuze develops a theory of sense which functions by the use of a series rather than a representation. The serial nature of meaning is important because it allows sense to be freed from any origin, end, or central concept.

  hegel is an immanent, dialectical idealist where as Kant has a transcendental critique
  Gilles Deleuze used the term immanence to refer to his "empiricist philosophy", which was obliged to create action and results rather than establish transcendentals. His final text was titled Immanence: a life...and spoke of a plane of immanence.

  my idea with re-reading infinite jest is that well hello it’s tattooed on the palm of my hand and i’ve only read it once and also that it’s so proliferative and makes me want to write when i read it/reminds me of why i want to be a writer at all
  goal: while re-reading iJ to make great strides in your short-story a week of 13-17 pages and also read macro and micro and all around but not to just copy endless quote after amazing quote you know? hone your extraction
  imporant: that feeling of momentum that iJ imparts and putting it to work with my own writing rather than hi-liting

  also maybe do some analysis when you find a great passage? you know? like take a 5 sentence long thing that just lights my fire and then in bold beneath analyze it? yeah!!

  Foucault was directly influenced by Canguilhem who “studied the instituationalization of medical knowledge: hello: you too can do the same when it comes to being a descendent of Infinite Jest, Pynchon, Saunders: resist the punishing anti-revolutionary idea that you shouldn’t follow after someone and that you should be original: also you are original if you add your own knowledge and style to theirs and advance it!

the thought too today that well the thing that i really should be doing is kind of shirking my social life and what not and parties and just chilling with patric and get to writing and delving into my brain and writing my at least one short story a week and submitting and in general just becoming serious/passionate about writing becuase it’s time and that awesomely this is what--in my mind--provides with the greatest pleasure too! what’s good is what’s good for me (maître morale)

  i love oxycodone and adderall and drugs in general because--why? escape from what? from my own inability to succeed for whatever reason? is there something deeper? why do i love drugs so much? adderall nearly ruined my life… the thought: maybe i’m hypodepressed but then… hmm… why? bad childhood etc. bad choices in past but still: life is pretty great and well i’m feeling great now--it’s almost as if i love drugs because of the immense pleasure that they afford? but isn’t that normal? but i guess what’s not normal is an addiction to said pleasure or the desire to return to it again and again rather than do quotidian duties and passions…
  my passion is maybe to make people read and feel à la d’Oxycodonne--
  but is that an escapist goal?

  Orin was removing rocks and hard clods from the Mom’s path as she worked the rented Rototiller, a wheelbarrow-shaped, gas-driven thing that roared and snorted and bucked and he remembers seemed to propel the Moms rather than vice versa, the Moms very tall and having to stoop painfully to hold on, her feet leaving drunken prints in the tilled earth. He remembers that in the middle of the tilling I came tear-assing out the door and into the backyard wearing some sort of fuzzy red Pooh-wear, crying, holding out something he said really unpleasant-looking in my upturned palm. He says I was around five and crying and was vividly red in the cold spring air. [...] Her outstretched hand, still Rototrembling, hung in the air before mine.

  ---> what is it about this? funny rototiller. vividly red in the cold spring air (brisk air Yes! i love that but i can see others complaining about that or thinking that that’s bad?) also the combo of tear-assing and “upturned palm” makes saying “tear-assing” o.k. you know what it is: it’s what Hilary talked about on my first edition of Jälpp

  The M.D. has both hands up and is patting the air to signify dispassion. He has a big blue jaw. At the only other emergency room I have ever been in, almost exactly one year back, the psychiatric stretcher was wheeled in and then parked beside the waiting-room chairs. These chairs were molded orange plastic; three of them down the row were occupied by different people all of whom were holding empty prescription bottles and perspiring freely. This would have been bad enough, but in the end chair, right up next to the strap-secured head of my stretcher was a T-shirted woman with barnwood skin and a trucker’s cap and a bad starboard list who began to tell me, lying there retrained and immobile, about how she seemingly overnight suffered a sudden and anomalous gigantism in her right breast, which she referred to as titty; she had an almost parodic Quebecois acccent and described the ‘titty’s’ presenting history and possible diagnosese for almost twenty minutes before I was rolled away.

  Despite its good intentions, it read like a Dickensian satire, counseling employees to break their meals into pieces (which “results in eating less and still feeling full”); to take two vacations a year (“can cut heart attack risk by 50%”); and to sell “unwanted possessions on eBay or Craigslist” for extra income.

  same sex marriage advocacy has made being anti-homophobic synonymous with being pro-marriage, drowning out centuries of critical thinking against the radicalized, colonial, patriarchal processes of state regulation of the family and gender through marriage: civil marriage is a tool of social control used by governments to regulate sexuality and family formation by establishing a favored form and rewarding it (in the u.s. with 1,000+ benefits)

  The line moves to accommodate a few more people, who society suddenly approves of, correcting the system and keeping it in place.

  marriage enforces sexual and gender norms and is a tool of control
  From these social movments, we understand marriage as a technology of social control, exploitation, and dispossession wrapped in a satin ribbon of sexist and heteropatriarchal romance mythology.

  is in fact pretty much the one person with whom Schtitt speaks candidly, lets his pedagogical hair down.
  One of the positives to being visibly damaged is that people can sometimes forget you’re there, even when they’re interfacing with you. It’s almost like they’re like: If nobody’s really in there, there’s nothing to be shy about. That’s why bullshit often tends to drop away around damaged listeners, deep beliefs revealed, diary-type private reveries indulged out loud.
  Schtitt has the sort of creepy wiriness of old men who still exercise vigorously. He has surprised blue eyes and a vivid white crewcut of the sort that looks virile and good on men who have lost a lot of hair anyway. And skin so clean-sheet-white it almost glows; an evident immunity to the sun’s UV; in pine-shaded twilight he is almost glowingly white, as if cut from the stuff of moons.
  ‘This myth of the competition and bestness we fight for you players here: this myth: they assume here always the efficient way is to plow in straight, go! The story that the shortest way between two places is a straight line, yes?’ ‘But what then when something is in the way when you go between places, no? Plow ahead go: collide: kabong.’
  [of latin phrases embossed places]: some special aphoristic nugget that’s supposed to describe and inform what the place’s philosophy’s all about THE MAN WHO KNOWS HIS LIMITATIONS HAS NONE
  So in short, Schtitt and the tall A.E.C.-optics man (i.e. Incandeza), whose fierce flat serve-and-haul-ass-to-the-net approach to the game had carried him through M.I.T. on a full ride w/ stipend, and whose consulting report on high-speed photoelectric tracking the U.S.T.A. mucky-mucks had found dense past all comprehending, found themselves totally simpatico on tennis’s exemption from stats-tracking regression.

  *** Schtitt’s thrust, and his one great irresistible attraction in the eyes of Mario’s late father: the true opponent, the enfolding boundary, is the player himself. Always and only the self out there, on court, to be met, fought, brought to the table to hammer out terms. The competing boy on the net’s other side: he is not the foe: he is more the partner in the dance. He is the what is the word excuse or occasion for meeting the self. You compete with your own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution. Disappear inside the game: break through limits: transcend: improve: win. Whichi is why tennis is an essentially tragic enterprise, to improve and grow as a serious junior, with ambitions. You seek to vanquish and transcend the limited self whose limits make the game possible in the first place. It is tragic and sad and chaotic and lovely. All life is the same, as citizens of the human State: the animating limits are within, to be killed and mourned, over and over again. ***

  fanatic / from latin: worshiper at a temple

  What you wish to sing of as tragic love is an attachment not carefully chosen. Die for one person? This is a craziness. Persons change, leave, die, become ill. They leave, lie, go mad, have sickness, betray you, die. Your nation outlives yo. A cause outlives you. Your U.S.A.’s do not seem to believe that you may each choose what to die for. Choose with care. This, is it not the choice of most supreme importance? Who teaches your U.S.A. children how to choose their temple? What to love enough not to think two times? What is the temple, thus, for U.S.A.?
  But you assume it’s always choice. You sit down with your little accountant’s ledger and soberly decide what to love? Always?
  The alternatives are--
  What if sometimes there is no choice about what to love? What if the temple comes to Mohammed? What if you just love? without deciding? You just do: you see her and in that instant are lost to sober account-keeping and cannot choose but to love?
  Then in such a case your temple is self and sentiment. Then in such an instance you are a fanatic of desire, a slave to your individual subjective narrow self’s sentiments; a citizen of nothing. You are by yourself and alone, kneeling to yourself. You fall; you blow here and there.

{{{{{ Taken together, these videos embark on poetic, formal, and structural elaborations of new forms of technology, language, narrative, identity, and humanity, portraying an extra-dimensional world that channels the existential dramas of our own. Any Ever’s core material is the perpetual flux of relationships among characters patterned to form constellations of meaning across videos. In the spirit of the work, which attempts to literalize the figurative to the point of abstraction, these formations can be imagined as having geometric properties that govern their interactions. The individual videos fit together, block, break, orbit, or attract one another in infinite shifting combinations. Any Ever’s master narrative is subjectively chosen by the viewer, read from the shifting topography of its seven parts. The philosophical tenet that one becomes everything one thinks, says, and does is both immediate and absolute in the work; Any Ever’s setting is simultaneity, in which being and becoming, along with everything else, co-exist. }}}}}

An individual may live in either of two states. In one, the busy, "divided" or "degenerate" state, he does not "possess himself" but identifies with his occupation or a monotonous action; in the other, "right" state, he is elevated to "Man", at one with all mankind.
To achieve this higher state of mind, the modern American scholar must reject old ideas and think for him or herself, to become "Man Thinking" rather than "a mere thinker, or still worse, the parrot of other men's thinking", "the victim of society", "the sluggard intellect of this continent".

      a lot of talk of dumpsters and using trash as a weapon

  sweden buys garbage from other countries--why can’t the U.S.?

  keep getting this flash that i should be reading IJ faster--and also a comparative flash of what page would another person be at? and also that I am fast at reading and I’ve already accomplished the feat of reading this book in the past but if i were at/i want to be around page 400 by now--and then move on to other books and get through them quick (ugh, never devour them, ugh never)... also on IJ: people may treat it with derision but that’s probably because they’ve only attempted the first 100 pages and given up and hide a herd like aninomsity for anyone who could get through it… distrust of values
  ps stor kunskap om konstig musik…
  also on weed observation of the creative process: that one is watching/observing somthing and has their own reflection on it with their own creative valuesa nd it is ina  kidn of meta-layer aboev the work so perceived and then is proliferated upon…
  and then power in creativity somehow comes from terriortialiation in capitalist-consumeristic-forms? that can be reduced to data?

  [referring to a substance] it no longer delimts and fills the hole. it no longer delimits.
  drugs being drugs because of concentration involved? i guess 2 concentrations: that of a substance/element ingestable at a significant concentration and also 2. not having to concentrate on Life in its infinite amount of concentrateable things but rather just on one dominant stimulus… and that perhaps this is why Sewing works for Patrick and reading/writing works for me--and the whole lesson of being able to abuse any action or hobby (crotchet needles…)

  there is a “virtue” in the fact that my writing style is proliferative but also it needs to be restricted a bit too--restrictoins are everything and also with a few more well placed words it could be made both complex but also easier to tell what’s going on… the plaecment of words that signify forward movement even if there is no logical progression as in Ashbery… but since it’s prose and not poetry it has to be a little more rationalizing and plotty

  and what if everyone say were to read my story and not like its complexity was simpy just another attempt in a series of attrition to try to not let more complex and winding and prolix stuff not get entered into the published realm becasue it’s “too hard to get through”? A la we want more Jodi Picoult, or like, Jodi Picoult as an intellectual type published material?

  also the thought that what if google docs crashed and you lost of all this material? also the thought what if the whole Grid collapsed and none of it even mattered anymore? also the thought what if your whole grid collapsed and you died and it never mattered to anyone but some of your friends and your mom to be scrutinized over? also what if the grid that i was motivated for these documents for fell, and i just retired to doing something else--styling, say, or Managing Roberta’s--(the worst maybe) and just poked at them every once and again.
  ^ which makes me also think perhaps the reason I have always failed at Jobs is because of 1. lack of respect for authority figures 2. grow used to the gifts and can’t contemplate the horrors of poverty again when i’m “in the money” 3. because managers/bosses recognize potential in me? and that they too must once have had potential but are now “locked in” somewhere--and also avoid taking too long to extricate yourself frmo restuarant jobs which are a kind of inertia here…

        when Sontag is against interpretation she is not against it in the broad sense (the nietzschean There is no truth, only interpretation) but rather plucking x y and z from an artwork and translating the artwork--saying what it really means
        that interpreting is revamping basicaly--a re-writing without doing so
        she says that interpretation thus presupposes a discrepancy between the clear meaning of the text and the demands of (later) readers. Interpretation seeks to resolve that discrepancy.
        Note also how Sontag has been arguing throughout the essay that we should take appearances seriously. She is entirely opposed the claim that artworks are something other than what they appear to be—that they are metaphors or symbols or allegories. She likens such criticism to the attempt to make the world something other than it is:
        The world, our world, is depleted, impoverished enough. Away with all duplicates of it, until we again experience more immediately what we have.

        Instead of blocking a text with interpretation, it can be opened by observation, description, and participation. Instead of transforming a text into another text with interpretation, the critic can allow the original text to remain itself and then create a companion text for it.
        The modern style of interpretation excavates, and as it excavates, destroys; it digs ‘behind’ the text, to find a sub-text which is the true one. The most celebrated and influential modern doctrines, those of Marx and Freud, actually amount to elaborate Orexin seemed to be essential for fending off sleep, and this changed how one might think of sleep. We know why we eat, drink, and breathe--to keep the internal state of the body adjusted. but sleep is a scientific puzzle. It may enable next-day activity, but that doesn't explain why rats deprived of sleep don't just tire; they die, within a couple of weeks. Orexin seemed to turn notions of sleep and arousal upside down. If orexin turns on a light in the brain, then perahps one could think of dark as the brain's natural state. "What is sleep?" might be a less profitable question than "What is awake?"

        There's an informal Q. and A., and then, afterward, the author's sad flirting with some fan.

        I visited the room in which this was being done. Yellow robotic arms, on the same scale as car-assembly robots, were mving the trays from here to there, making bursts of sound like a nut being loosened in a tire shop. "Summertime" played on a radio. A computer monitor showed enhanced images of reactions on the plates: a fuzzy grid of light and dark dots, like a blurry telescope of distant stars.

  GOING 4 THE CONSTITUTION AS A SOURCE OF DEBATE
  Most politicians consider the validity of the Constitution off limits as a subject for debate. The Constitution, and the structure of government that it established, provides the backdrop, but never the subject, for every controversy.
  It's often noted that the u.s. is goverened by the world's oldest written constitution that is still in use. This is usually stated as praise, though most other rpoducts of the 18th century, like horse-borne travel and leech-based medecine haev been replaced by improved models.  (jefferson thought that it should be replaced every 19 years--any longer and it would be an act of force and not of right.)
  Left & Right can ask whether the pervasive dysfunction in Washington is in spite of the Constitution or because of it.
  [...] with an air of perpetual amusement [...]

  can levy takes on the slaves imported
  1865: thirteenth amendment (slavery nor involuntary servitude shan't exist in the U.S.
      The Senate--original sin of the constitution whose primary function has been to stop bills which are often supported b a popularly elected President and House members, from becoming law. The Senate = Graveyard For Legislation, an instution that stops change. Though Obama will spend 8 years in office, his tenure as the actualy leader of the national government lasted about a year and a half (between 2009 and 2010 when the democrats held more than 60 votes (enough needed to overcome a filibuster) obama pushed through health-care reform, financial reform (the Dodd-Frank legislation: improved accountability & transparency to end "too big to fail" protect consumers from abusive financial practices...) a bailout for the auto-industry, repeal of don't ask don't tell,--when in 2010 Obama's part lost control of the House and fell below the filibuster threshold in the Senate.
        the constitution mandates an instutional paralytic posture
        "the u.s. has never been a democracy--it's  arepresentative republic with heightened democratic principles"
        the senate where it's not the tyranny of the majority but of the minority
        supreme court allowed gerrymandering for partisan gain (one of the most important decisions in the decade)
        Obama "it just insn't nrmal this obstrctin, not like the fndrs imagnd" Obama was engaging in the politicaian's customary absolution of the founders: the virutes of the system are all due to them; the defects are all due to us.

      people do still live in trailers! it is not just something of a b-side movie of a radical director that people live in them and driving by them is something that happens in rural U.S.A. on a daily basis! that we never see trailer parks in NYC and it’s almost yes as if i’m directing this micro-tirade at NYC residents? Are they my audience? How to make all of America, asctually wait all of the world my audience? How to appeal to human feeling? but ehn also one chooses their audience--yes, and that has somethign to do with that magic of limitation, limiting one’s genius, water droplet carving a hole but a massive river spread out no trace of it left…

  Hal had asked him when he’ll start coming back to their room to sleep, which made Mario feel good. [...] Mario loves Hal so much it makes his heart beat hard. he doesn’t have to wonder if the difference now is him or his brother because Mario never changes. [...] And he can feel his heart going out into the world through them, which is good for insomnia. A woman’s voice, calling for help without any real urgency--not like the screams that would signify the Moms laughing or screaming at night--sounds from a darkened upper window. Mario thinks it might not be out of the question that she might lend tapes to a fellow listener if he could ask. He usually checks etiquette questions with hal, who is incredibly knowledgeable and smart. When he thinks of Hal his heart beats and his forehead’s thick skin becomes wrinkled. [...] Mario’d fallen in love with the first madame Psychosis programs because he felt like he was listening to someone sad read out loud from yellow letters she’d taken out of a shoebox on a rainy P.M., stuff about heartbreak and people you loved dying and U.S. woe, stuff that was real. It is increasingly hard to find valid art that is about stuff that is real in this way. The older Mario gets, the more confused he gets about the fact that everyone at ETA over the age of about Kent Blott finds stuff that’s really real uncomfortable and they get embarrassed. It’s like there’s some rule that real stuff can only get mentioned if everybody rolls their eyes or alguhs in a way that isn’t happy. The worst-feeling thing that happened today was at lunch when michale Pemulis told Mario he had an idea of setting up a Dial-a-Prayer telephone service for atheists in which the atheist dials the number and the line just rings and rings and no one answers. It was a joke and a good one, and Mario got it; what was unpleasant was that mario was the only one at the big table whose laugh was a happy laugh; everybody else sort of looked down like they were laughing at somebody with a disability. The whole issue was far above Mario’s head, and he was unable to udnerstand Lyle’s replies when he tried to bring the confusion up. And Hal was for once no help, because Hal seemed even more uncomfortable and embarrassed than the fellows at lunch, and when Mario brought up real stuff Hal called him Booboo and acted like he’d wet himself and Hal was going to be very patient about helping him change.

        write down your own laws--and craft them well or else they can be disputed (by yourself included)

        tennis--so many angles, spins, vectors, lines… football punting: one single act…
        writing: writing one story or 29 at the same time… ?

        writing method: maybe to craft 10 idesa that you can concentrate on completely (plot points? feelings? yes and yes) and then connect them… because when you start just writing it’s hard to have that type of concentration that’s “frighteningly total” yknow? “a massive developmental carrot that he hadn’t seen the likes of since he was 14” but how can you monitor your own writing development? you know how: but not writing so complexly and long-windedly or by honing that skill and also by the completion of more short stories…
        see t.ex how this is long winded and complex but completely get-able:
      “So and then the only really cardiac grade romantic relationshuip of Orin’s life took bilateral root at a distance, during games, without one exchanged personal phoneme, a love communicated -- across grassy expanses, against stadiums’ monovocal roar -- entirely through stylize repetitive motions -- his functional, hers celebratory -- their respective little dances of devotion to the spectacle they were both -- in different rolls -- trying to make as entertaining as possible.”
      ^ seeeeeeeeeeeeeee it’s doable and different but of the same genus as your sentences…


      thought: taht wouldn’t it be nice if writing too had these clearly defined right angles and it’s completion could be “figured out” ( i suppose thinsg like grammar and words and structure and style are the right angles of writing) but then also WRITING IS INFINITE and it can expand beyond any degree number and that’s the reason why i hate math in the first place (its limitation)

attention economy--vying for your attention (notice how the next episode of a show begins on netflix automatically…)

  “and in sum this whole instance of unprepared-goal-attainment-trauma is unbelievably gruesome and sad, and it’s one historical reason why all accredited tennis academies have to have a Ph.D.-level counselor on full-time staff, to screen student athletes for their possibly letahl reactions to ever actually reaching the level they’ve been pointed at for years. E.T.A.’s staff counselor is the bird-of-prey-faced Dr. Dolores Rusk, M.S., Ph.D., and she’s regarded by the kids as whatever’s just slightly worse than useless.”

  is your will-to-go-to-college a giving up in a sense? a giving up without even having tried (all hypenated)? because like you have the same level sort of cognition as you would have if you were to go to college for four years although you would get better at writing academicese papers and would also get feedback from other writers as opposed to the nonwriters hilary, olivia, p… ? becuase then as aforementioned all you need to do to publish something is to think back to the paper writing process in H.S. and just concentrate a little longer than it would take to write a term-paper (for a novel, a Rickett’s binder) and also not tell anyone what you’re working on becuase then that ruins it… and then just Lie? that you’ve published when you submit it to TNI?/N+! say you’ve published psuedonymically? in any case it’s not necessary that you go to college but you should maybe go check it out and then get published anyway? because isn’t it actually really importnat to you that you show that you don’t need to go to the college once you have the intenret? https://www.pw.org/content/literary_magazines

in order to be a tennis pro you would have to wake up early almost everyday and do a bunch of different drills take 1000 backhands 1000 serves 1000 kickserves etc. but what is the equivalent of that for writing? becuase it must be the same in becoming a great author that you would equally have to do such kind of exercises? is it simply just writing? can you prompt-write everyday for exercise in your writing capacity? or does it have to come from somehwere else, in some other form--of course there are multiple types of exercises, but then what are they? figure that out and then do them! (?) tho: couldn’t you just work on one project and have an exercise of total dedication? (i’d say yes, but also that the psyche kind of wanes in duration/intensity at certain times but it’s importnat that you still write/go to town on your stuff everyday and work through the hate of it…)

  “It turned out Pat Montesian liked the color black a lot. She was dressed -- really kind of overdressed, for a halfway house -- in black leather pants and a black shirt of silk or something silky. Outside the bay window a Green Line train was laboring up the first Enfiled hill in late-summer rain.”

  Pat had said it didn’t matter at this point what he thought or believed or even said. All that mattered was what he did. If he did the right things, and kept doing them for long enough, what Gately thought and believed would magically change. Even what he said. She’d seeni t happen again and again, and to some awfully unlikely candidates for change. She said it had happened to her. THe left side of her face was very alive and kind.

  Like many gifted bureaucrats, Hal’s mother’s adoptive brother Charles Tavis is physically small in a way that seems less endorcine than persepctival. His smallness resmbles the smallness of something that’s farther away from you than it wants to be, plus is receding. (...) seeming to recede even as he bears down. [...] The danger-sign to watch out for is if Tavis suddenly gets very quiet and very still. Because then he seems, perspectivally, to grow. He seems, sitting there, to rush in at you, dopplering in at a whisper. Almost looming over you from across the huge desk. If shit meets administrative fan, kids coming out of his mandible-doored office come out pale and rubbing their eyes, not from tears but from this depth-perspective skewing that C.T. suddenly effects, when there’s shit.

  how talking with someone about something reveals knowledge you didn’t know you knew--
  is that because talking is performative? and you’re basically doing an impromptu performance?
  per-fornir - to bring about form
  self-knowledge: information someone draws upon when asked “What Am I Like?”
  a component of the self-concept
  our mental representations of ourselves and static / dynamic aspects under
  The Cognitive Self; The Affective Self; The Executive Self
  motives: self-enhancement, consistency, accuracy
  knowing one’s self - goal achievement thus survival adaptive
  goal=interaction between the executive forebrain and the reptilian brain stem toward something

  insouciant - casual lack of concern; nonchalant; untroubled
  aplomb - self-confidence in a demanding situation
  blithe - cheerful indifference considerd to be callous or improper
  learned helplessness - when someone is repeatedly exposed to an averse stimulus they will begin to behave as if they are helpless to change it--even when opportunity presents itself; a dog which can easily jump over a low barrier to escape an electrical shock in the floor but doesn’t because it has the expectation that nothing will prevent it from being shocked.

  reading increases self-awareness and emotional empathy which is like MAGIC in LIFE (especially human life which is removed from state-of-nature type scenarios…) social perception, emotional intelligence; emotional writing: delving into emotions at a neuronal level almost and tracing them out and faisant disparaitre boundaries between human subjectivities into a sort of emotional objectivity akin to MDMA-literature

  the unmistakable clanks of tinkles of dumpster-divers and can-miners going after dumpsters’ cans and bottles, the district Redemption Center down in West Brighton and actually even boldly sharinga  storefront with Liquor World liquor store so the can-miners can do like one-stop redeeming and shopping. Which Lenz finds repellent to the maximus, and shares his feelings with Green. The noises parallaxing in rom out over the city’s winking grid, at night.

  confabulate - fabricate imaginary expereinces as compensation for memory loss

  [on cocaine] Lenz doesn’t notice the way Green’s face sort of crumples blankly when Lenz mentions the issue of late mothers.
  Lenz euphorically tells Green how he once got the tip of his left finger cut off in a minibike chain once and how but within days of intensive concentration the finger had grown back and regenerated itself like a lizard’s tail, confounding doctoral authorities. Lenz says that was the incident in youth after which he got in touch with his own unsual life-force and energois de vivre and knew and accepted that he was somehow not like the run of common men, and began to accept his uniqueness and all that it entailed.
  Lenz clues Green in on it’s a myth the Nile crocodile is most dreaded species of crocodile, that the dread Estuarial crocodile of saltwater habits is a billion times more dreaded by those in the know.
  [...] running like hell down Boylston for the Auditorium T-Stop to evade prosecution, vowed never to use his lethally adept akido skills except in the most compulsory situation of defending the innocent and/or weak.
  Lenz tells Green how once he was at a Halloween party where a hydrocephalic woman wore a necklace made of dead gulls.
  [...] He says there’s another recurving nightmare about a clock with hands frozen eternally at 1830 that’s so trouser-foulingly scary he won’t even burden Green’s fragile psychology with the explicits of it.
  Lenz regales how at that Halloween Party with the necklace of birds there’d been allegedly a Concavity-refugee infant there, at the party, at the home of South Boston orthodontist taht dealt Lidocaine to Bing-retailers on the prescriptional dicky, a normal-sized and unferal infant but totally without a skull, lying in a kind of raised platform or dais by the fireplace with its shapeless and deskulled head-region supported and, like (shuddering), contained in a sort of lidless plastic box, ands its eyes were sunk way down in its face, which was the consistency of like quicksand, the face, and its nose concave and its mouth hanging out over either side of the boneless face, and the total head had like conformed to the inside of the containing box it was contained in, the head, and appeared roughly sqaure in overall outline, the head, and the woman with the lei of gull-heads and other persons in costumes had ingested hallucinogens and drank mescal and ate the little worms in the mescal and had performed circled rituals around the box and platform around 2355h., worshipping the infant, or as they termed it simply The Infant, as if there were only One.
  Lenz claims to remember some experiences which he says happened to him in vitro.

  propitiate - pra-pish-e-ate: win/regain the favor of a god-ess by doing something that pleases them

  Green opines that if Boston AA is a cult that like brainwashes you, he guesses he’d got himself to the point where his brain needed a good brisk washing, which Lenz knows is not an original view, being exactly what big blockheaded Don Gately repeats about once a diem.

  It’s true, the New Yorker guy, the film guy who replaced the guy who replaced Rafferty, it’s true that he kept saying that the films were like the planet’s most psychotic psyche working out its shit right there on the screen and asking you to pay to watch him.

The guy was one of the high-caliber critics who said in print that here Incandeza had put drama ahead three or four leaps in one visionary leap and after The Stork finally counld’nt keep a straight face anymoer and spilled the beans on NPR radio during a “Fresh Air” dramaturgy-panel the New Yorker guy dropped from critical sight for like a year and then when he came back he had it in for Himself in a very big way, which is understandable.

  “trying to impress people by reading infinte jest” say the people who couldn’t quite get through infinite jest--i hear a lot of slave revolt there--sure the book is well hyped and hyped sometimes by the wrong people, but anyone who makes that claim probabyl got to about page 400 and then just couldn’t… arms too tired for lugging it around. and also: it’s a book! a great one at that! full of the empathy, sentiment, erudition that i’ve seen in a long time as far as modern/post-modern novels go… furthermore about its length: Anna Karenina? War and Peace? people say the same shit about ij that they do about Ulysses (another hard book to make it through, but equally as impressive in its own right(s)) so fuck the h8rs!!!!!
  HAHAHAHH ^ that angry response was because someone said why not to read it:
  but then:
  3. You don’t actually read books.
  After a few nights of reading 2-4 pages before getting too tired to keep your eyes open, it will eventually dawn on you that you never actually read books before bed. You’ll try to remember the last book you read and what time of day you did most of your reading. You won’t be able to think of this. You’ll look at your bookshelf to try to jog your memory and realize that you haven’t really read most of the books you own, except the ones by stand up comedians that are basically just their stand up acts written down.
  But you will not finish Infinite Jest. You won’t finish it because you are lazy (and dumb) and who wants to read that stupid book anyway? As a result you will never read those books in your theoretical book queue. You will spend the rest of your life reading blogs that summarize stories from the New York Times in a snarky tone and you’ll change the subject whenever anyone brings up Infinite Jest at a party.
  5. You will die alone.
  Not because you didn’t finish reading Infinite Jest, but the whole ordeal is a pretty good example of what a pathetic, unlovable piece of shit you are.

  he claimed an attack of schizophrenia rendered his singing unintelligible but his performance translated some underlying truths
  every once in a while something exciting happens.
  what if he was signaling in some unknown language--to aliens?
  Jantjie's performance was not meaningless – precisely because it delivered no particular meaning (the gestures were meaningless), it directly rendered meaning as such – the pretence of meaning.
  And this brings us to the crux of the matter: are sign language translators for the deaf really meant for those who cannot hear the spoken word? Are they not much more intended for us – it makes us (who can hear) feel good to see the interpreter, giving us a satisfaction that we are doing the right thing, taking care of the underprivileged and hindered.
  It was like great charity spectacles which are not really about children with cancer or flood victims, but about making us, the public, aware that we are doing something great, displaying solidarity.
  And was this also not the truth about the whole of the Mandela memorial ceremony? All the crocodile tears of the dignitaries were a self-congratulatory exercise, and Jangtjie translated them into what they effectively were: nonsense. What the world leaders were celebrating was the successful postponement of the true crisis which will explode when poor, black South Africans effectively become a collective political agent. They were the Absent One to whom Jantjie was signalling, and his message was: the dignitaries really don't care about you. Through his fake translation, Jantjie rendered palpable the fake of the entire ceremony

  The majority of people who voted for Obama did so because things would not change--and they fear radical right wing politics’ potentially radical changes.
  The lesson to be learned is that freedom of choice only functions if a complex network of legal, educational, ethical, economic and other conditions is present as the invisible background to the exercise of our freedom.
  Yurodivy is the Russian Orthodox version of the holy fool who feigns insanity so he can deliver a message so dangerous for those in power that, if stated directly, it would cause a brutal reaction.
  One day they meet a starving deserter in a forest and bring him some things he asks them for.
  “When we come back with the food and blanket he says “you’re very kind.”
  We say: “We weren’t trying to be kind. We’ve brought you these things because you absolutely need them. That’s all.”

performance art peice where there was the skinniest man i’ve ever seen with a long mane of thin red hair (which made it not look like concentration camp jews) standing on a field that had like wackamoles in slow motion coming up but instead of moles they were crops (like wheat, but oddly slimy) and he was spraying a thick milky material that looked a bit like ejaculate n the field and then these wheat stalks would come up and the man had a sycthe thicker than he was at places and would cut immediately all the wheat and then milkyly water them and the cut them again (perhaps Nietzsche’s ploughshare of evil?)

  neighborhoods Tiny Ewell has described as Depressed Resedential, unending rows of crammed-together triple-decker houses with those tiny sad architectural differences that seem to highlight the essential sameness, with sagging proches and psoriatic paint0jobs or oluminum siding gone carbuncular from violent temperature-swings, yard-litter and dishes and patchy grass and fenced pets and children’s toys lying around in discarded attitudes and eclectic food-smells and wildly different patterned curtains or blinds in a house’s different windows due to these old houses are carved up inside into apartments for like alienated B.U. students or Canadian and Concavity-displaced families or even moer alienated B.C. students, or probably it looks like the bulk of these lease-holdesr are Green-and-Bonkesque yougner blue-collar hard-partying types that have posters of the Choosy Mothers or Snout or the Bioavailable Five in the bathroom and black lights in the bedroom and oil-change stains in the driveway and that throw their supper dishes into the yard and buy new dishes at Caldor insetad of washing their dishes and that still, in their twentiets, ingest Substances nightly and use party as a verb and put their sound-system’s speakers in their apartments’ windows facing out and crank the volume out of sheer high-spirit obnoxiousness because they still have their girlfriends to pound beers with and do shotguns of dope into the mouth of and do lines of Bing off various parts of the naked body of, and still find pouinding beers and donig bongs and lines fun and get to have fun on a nightly after-work basis, cranking the tunes out into the neighborhood air. A non-peanut M&M box is like intaglioed into the concrete of the sidewalk under Green, so bleached by the elements and turned bone-white and is only barely identifiable as a nonpeanut M&M box, for instance. Someone has put Polynesian-music speakers in their window, pretty clearly. Creepy slack-key steel guitar balloons across the dim street, booms off the sagging facades opposite, its Don Ho and the Sol Hoopi Players, the grass-skirt-and-foamy breakers sound that makes Green put his fingers in his ears while at the same time he moves more urgently toward the Hawaiian-music source, a pink or aqua three-decker with a second floor dormer and a red-shingled roof with a blue and white Quenucker flag on a pole protruding form a window in the dormer and serious JBL speakers facing outward in the two windows on either side of the flag, with the screens off so you can see the woofers throbbing like brown bellies hula-ing, bathing the 1700 lock of W. Brainerd in dreadful ukuleles and hollow-log percussives. The lit windows make slender rectangles of light out across the yard, which the yard is a sty. Something about Randy Lenz’s movements up ahead, the high-kneed tiptoes skulk of a vaudeville fiend up to no good at all, keep Green from calling out to him even if he could have made himself heard over what to him was a roar of blood and breath and Ho.

  how memory serves one better when Intent is more… ghastly? or intentional? that when an agent is WILLING something there is a spike somehow in the neural landscape(s)--to not remember small actions but The Big Things? monotony?

  produce a large volume

  INTENT--an agent’s purpose in performing an action--to a goal
  all intent as acting under a description
  also it’s possible to act intentionally without a reason--”why were you doing that?” “I wasn’t aware I was doing that” but: “not by no reason at all”
  Ian Hacking: The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists as well as the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions; descriptions that can be assumed by an individual as he or she acts.
  Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them.
  pushing someone on the playground: why did you do that? “to show who’s boss” “because I was provoked” “because I have ADHD”
  According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by humans' bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur and the events we engage in. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. People are substantially (though not entirely) the people they understand themselves to be.
  Acting under a description also has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Hacking argues that descriptions change as the shared understandings of particular acts change. Hacking provides the following example. 17th-century courtiers tickled the genitalia of Louis XIII. Were they guilty of child abuse? The description of child abuse available in the 21st century did not exist in the 17th century. "In short, the charge of child abuse may be true of the past, but it was not true in the past. The description only becomes true with time. For Hacking, retroactive descriptions are, at the very least, controversial."[6]
  The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts form an ever shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions readily ascribed to those acts as the practices of society

  my own father, somtime around midlife. We watched him get consumed with a sort of entertainment. It wasn’t pretty.
  Yes. Broadcast television. The program in question was called “M*A*S*H.” The title was an acronym, not a command. As a boy I can recall some confusion on this point.
  (...) started to schedule his Thursday around it--always had his supper watching the program. Mummykins used to tease him, think it was adorable.
  ‘Cuteness in fathers, this is rare’ There was no way Marathe was going to tocuh the evident U.S.A. childhood expression Mummykins. [running joke about horrifying petnames]
  in what I remember all too well was called syndication (...) My old man started to find the syndicated reruns extremely important to him, too. As in like not to be missed.
  Marathe said ‘Virtually a bombardment of this U.S.A. broadcast comedy program.’ (bombardment of cable programs: no choice but to watch; the ability to choose central to U.S. ideology--or that it’s even possible in the first place to choose)
  He started to keep a small television downa at work. Down at the distributorship.
  Steeply appeared to Marathe to be uncalculating in his staments. Mummykins began to have to lie to get them out of engagements that would have infringed. [a lot of Freudian psychology in iJ--or is it that just in describing family pathology we think of Freud? and is DFW trying to make a Freudian case consciously or unconscously? how many academics smoke weed?) Neither of them talked about it. I don’t remember any of us trying to name the thing out loud--this dark shift in his attachment to the program “MASH”
  ‘The organism of family simply shifted to accomodate.’
  It was at some point during this gradual shift the notebook first appeared. he began writing notes in a notebook as he viewed. But only when viewing M*A*S*H. The scrupulous recording of tiny details, in careful order, for puproses you could just tell were both urgent and furtive.


you don’t have to write down every thought that you have and if you do go ahead and go through and edit/delete/repair them as you do (isn’t that what writing is? proliferation upon the writing of ideas? but rookie mistake to leave the thoughts in all their unadulterated unglory)

  so i have this feeling sometimes that i can’t be successful as a writer because i have a part time job--and that the dread of that part-time job is so intense and time consuming (even tho it’s part time) that how could I ever accomplish something say, write a book the size of infinite jest? but this is ridiculous: IJ was written while DFW was working, think also novels written by uni professors? who have more work on their plate than even if you worked 6 days a week at Roberta’s? it’s a little bit of bad faith on your part--
  also why the dread sometimes when it comes to writing? a kind of anti-motivator? a way of punishment? because you know that you contain the answers but that what? you just resist writing but then so often you are in sucidial agony that you’ve yet to publish anything and you’re 22 years old and by most scales a failure? no money, in debt, no college, no good job, nothing published--just a lot of books read (but then perversely enough you are told you are a “genius” by many people) squanderer? is that what I amount to? of course not, escalade is amazing: then WORK on it for 2 hours today and then submit it to N+1 seriously! what else? whenever else are you going to do it? and no you don’t have to send it to a bunch of other people who rarely read the books you do (has hilary, olivia, cajsa, maja, patric read Infinite Jest, Gravity’s Rainbow, Crying of Lot 49, George Saunders (anyone?) ?) so just go ahead and do it and resist the urge to tell patric that you have submitted a story for publication to them (in case of rejection) BUT HAVING THAT REJECTION SLIP IF IT SHOULD OCCUR WILL BE A SUPREME CELEBRATION OF THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRYING AND STARTING TO SUBMIT, and a LIFE SIGN

  [clear writing] I know too, K, that you cringe whenever I mention the pedophile thing, and feel that is hould not be placed in any story, because it overwhelms it and is too terrible for words. But I’d like to point out that my nieces are two beautifulk, talented, and privileged girls, who see their grand-uncle only a few days a year; and that our uncle is not a bad man, just a sick one. so please quell any squeamishness or horror and bear in mind that it could be worse.
  Clara was eaten in October. Aftewrard, my nieces cried, blahblahblah. My sister, too; Clara had been her first cat. And through the years, whenever my sister felt sad about anyhting--fight, failed test, car accident, etc.--Clara sensed it, came to her, and sat in her lap.
  She always worked the same schedule as he, so that no other female official could “get him.” For the past five years, apparently, she’d been failing to have his baby, owing to “mystery infertility,” and was racked by shame.
  *!*!*!*! But I felt a sadness. I couldn’t knock it; I don’t know why. At any rate I had to contemplate the prospect of my family eating wheat lasagna, which had goitrogenic effects; though, regarding that, they didn’t believe me. My brothers, both dentists, had told me that my nurtitionist work should be illegal, because only doctors are qualified to dispense supplements; my sister said that I’d never make rent as a nutritionist, and that I should give up. I was forbiiden to fofer Kunda the most common-sense advice. I considered, still with wonder, my clients who’d got pregnant: a dozen women in their mid-forties who each three had failed I.V.F. treatments before they did protocalls with me. Many had had repeat miscarriages, several had ovarian cysts, and all had tried unsuccessfully for years’ but once we had replenished their minerals, supported their throid and adrenals, used herbs to balance their hormones, and changed their diets, they’d all conceived. They’d all had healthy, non-retarded babies. They’d sent me referrals, but not enough. My sister was right: I couldn’t pay my bills. I’d spent a few hundred bucks on Google AdWords, but I made bad ads and they didn’t work. My Web site was ugly. I’d had some unsatisfied clients, old ladies who’d gained weight isnead of losing it, and they’d Yelped me, calling me a quack. I thought how, if I helped Kunda, I’d ahve a district medical officer’s Yelp endorsement, and how amny clients that’d get me. I didn’t give a fig about Kunda’s sensitivity; I wa dizzy, from actual dizziness or from grandiosity; I thought, So what if my degree’s an Internet diploma?

Plus she got the creepy feeling the man ha dupped the film-speeed in these few-frame human flashes, to thwart just such study.

  Marathe took the opportunity of her inattention to commit to his memory the office’s facts.

He had the ability of splitting his mind’s thinking along several parallel tracks.

  Gately, for several months before he did his State assault-bit, was disastrously involved with one Pamela Hoffman-Jeep, his first girl ever with a hyphen, a sort of upscale but directionless and not very healthy and pale and incredibly passive Danvers girl that worked in Purchasing for a hospital supply co. in Swampscott and was pretty definitely an alcoholic and drank birght drinks with umbrellas in Rte. 1 clubs in the late P.M. until she swooned and passed out with a loud clunk. That’s what she called it -- “swooned.” The swooning and passing out witha  loud clunk as her head hit the table was more or less a nightly thing, and Pamela Hoffman-Jeep fell automatically in love with any man she termed “chivalrous”374 enough to carry her out to the parking lot and drive her home without raping her, which rape of an unconscious head-lolling girl she termed “Taking Advantage”.

  and that this is kind of a forced directive--this “art must be entertaining” aspect of art--based on market-demand! no one will buy your book if it’s not--and yet an author can still have money if he’s not--the money is out there--rich liberals in palaces on central park west are waiting to give it to you “it’s out there for the taking”

  psychic wellbeing is pretty dependent on knowing that one’s feelings aren’t speific to… one.

Is it based on radical internal loneliness and absence of empathy? or perceieved absence of emapthy? aka the supreme service of letting someone know that you’ve expereinced that too and it’s O.K.--? “ever notice how, in the end, when you need someone, someone’s always there?”

The wraith says it mars the memory of the end of his animate life, this son’s retreat into the periphery of life’s frame. and to imagine, that it was within DFW’s genius that this is the motivating extended conceit passage that inspires countless writers to write and not just say nothign as a figurant but actually something! wow! an odd vividness in himself at being swabbed and maybe even generally admired by someone who;s an underground local intellectual-dash-art-type celebrity.

  wow looking at eric medlock’s fa cebook insane how divergent our paths were? also wow what the fack???? and also Amber Whittier--what? wearing the indian costumes--also going to gymnastics together--melted crayons under the trampoline in summer--and then “talked to my roomates--they are definitely feeling a rave/glow party” and now she’s a liscensed cosmetologist and does weird henna tattoos with that thick paint u get from joann fabrics--strange also that Ryan Dixon was definitely gay pretending to be a pimp and i the prostitute and wanting him to fart on my face (???) just ate some pb&j so, very gassy--why????

  PEOPLE IN THESE VENTED “MONEY BOXES” CLUTCHING RABIDLY AT DOLLAR BILLS--NO WAIT THERE SEEM TO BE 3 $5 BILLS IN THERE…

  about putting people out of their misery: “that boy was in constant pain” “do you want us to start judging sentening based on the value of the victim?”

  I’m willing to be 100% passionately devoted to writing at a ll times of the time from the second i wake up to the second i go to bed

  Unexplained panic sharpens the senses almost past enduring. You perceive things very intensely. Lyle’s counsel had been to turn the perception and attention on the fear itself--
  Lyle said taht the most advanced level of Vaipassana or ‘Insight’ meditationn consisted in sitting in fully awakened contemplation of one’s own death.
  if it came down to getting high or playing tennis it would be a nearly impossible choice to make. The distant way in which this fact appalled me itself appalled me.

  dyed-in-the-wool: thoroughgoing; all-out, a dyed in the wool populist
  tapir--pig like mammal with a prehensile snout
prehensile--capable of grabbing (prehensile tail/snout)

  and even the Classic Comics version of Ethan From was now beyond his abilities.

  photosynthesizing / thought-prophylaxis
  p seeming doesn’t care for flriting online/hooking up w people all that much--admirable, estimable in some weird way--that he doesn’t even check his facebook messages etc. and flirts w hardly no one and is MINE

  A combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been shown to alleviate symptoms of easy laughing and crying (pseudobulbar affect) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.





my life is amazing w olivia n hilary and gewet and maja and my brother and mom and Patric, and … so much other stuff… and myself my own best friend (on own worst enemy: quit doing that: anyone with a body and brain acn be DFW or Chauncer or Camus or Gibson or Pynchon: overcome your own limits)

  i’m interested in drugs because they radically alter the centerof one’s existence--if we are made of mg of say, calcium, then 9.1 mg of menthol is going to intrigue me

  TAKE ME TO BELLEVUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (UN-INSURED) GENIUS IDEA YESYESYSEYSEYSEYSEY MED ALERT BRACELET

  “joint task force”
  “crime only happens in NYC on netflix

  to think that h sa att b.troe skulle inte prata med mig for langre an ett par minutre--dra at helvete! han skulle inte prata med dig for att du har ingen smak…

  att vaera nagon! forestall dig om jag hade erbjudat hari tilll olivias inatt--o hur det skulle ha forandrat grejerna--
  mycket onanism inatt men d var ju bra med: vad jag vill ha ar att vaera en forfattare som ha manga vanner--






  how i am kind of capable of not feeling anything when i don’t want to--aka hilary being pissed off = don’t care
  breaking up with tony -- not that much sadness other than crying a few times
  hmm…
  but also this is also adderall day after homeostasis no neurotransmitters talking--
  redbull is what you need--redbull and vegetables and focus and coffee and intensity
  is it possible to abuse books? yes: if they’re all the same i.e. danielle steele, dean koontz novels--but compulsively reading say tolstoy, then dickens, then whitehead… no (i guess in that case the abuse would be the more self-abuse if you merely became a scholar--the warning against becoming a scholar!)

  “i didn’t see that much ice in her veins”
  “she bailed out on her brother--she came from the same iceberg as her brother…”
  again: if in need of dialogue or how to write it or what it looks like when it’s good, look no further than L&O



  “an academic Diamond in the very rough Roxbury Crossing [...]” diamond in the rough--diamonds only occur among rough--the predominant is rough--/rabble

  candy striper (hospital assitant) known so for their red and whtie female outfit--creepily there is an ad for a halloween ostume w nurse w small paper hat holding up massive syringe

  that chris sayles had MS and then my mom just kind of stopped talking to her? did that happen--? sad geo metro double beeping--

  gays are gifted with the ability to intellectually/aritistically focus on anything they want without threat of baby--and maybe that’s why they’re hated a lot: because of the luck of the draw that they get to be two men in union--(which is why lesbianism isn’t mention so often… because… well who cares (?) woops) pure pleasure (and maybe that’s why AIDS gets brought up because it would seem the one thing against gay men, the one risk or bad thing resulting from it--)

  [Lynchian]: “You believe in shit, Hal?’ ‘shit?’ ‘I don’t know. Little kid shit. Telekiniption. Ghosts. Parabnormal shit.’ ‘Just going to yank you off this window’ ‘somebody did come by before,’ he said. ‘there was somebody standing back there about amybe a hour back. But he just stood there. Then he went away. Or… it.’ A full-body shiver. O gående pa gatan o plotsligt nagon kommer runt ett horn o e elak o som mannen bakom soppstugan i Mulholland



  also: fear walking around outside until seeing other (nice) humans--imagine living in the deep ghetto? and imagine also that ghettos (scary ones) even exist--a kind of danger zone of malice and malfaisance

  fear of going to bed alone at night and being home alone is probably caused by just being fearful at night in general of jennifer--recurring childhood dream of her crashing thru a glass window to come steal me away from my mother at night
  also mom’s threat of “going to send you to jennifers” also murky dream of laying awake at night with a candle light (?) latern thing and nothing other than that but it must have been something right? and also not to put false memories in your head--beware of that.



  att min bror vaxte upp under samma handlingarna som jag--o hur jag vill skriva for bade honom och min mor for att visa att allt var inte forlorat men mer sa att jag gjorde vackert nagot fult! o jag ska gora precis det! o har redan skonat mitt liv o han hans o hon hons men jag vill ga uppat aven mer, o dela… o hur nar jag skriver jag skriver mycket om kanslor--o hur d kommer fran en plats av att ha erfarat stora kanslor nar jag var ung--men samtidigt att jag kanner mig som om jag har inte kant sa mycket om min fars dodelse? o hur d kanske e forknippat med mina sexuella preferenser? konstigt--

  how “at will” and “will” are connected--how willing something is kind of like a plane at supersonic speed breaking through barriers that it doesn’t yet know exist there but does anyway and will anyway regardless of any barriers suddenly coming up--
  psychic economy
  personal creative economy

  weird how when someone searching for powerful langauge the only returns are for Business--
  you instantly free because

  of course IJ makes me depressed: drugs and my sucidial thoughts, all this Freudian strife, reading it on adderall both times… of course, but through this pain will come unending beauty in both my own writing and neural landscape--i’m determined to take it places, and not just let it remain on my palm… and to think that it’s on my fingers that are always touching keys--
  needless to say FUCK anyone who says otherwise about this book and its tattooing on your fingers…

  selvage--an edge produced on fabric to keep the seams from unraveling

  but that perfume wasn’t even intended for you nor for this day but is merely from the dryers at Superclean


  acerbic: sharp and forthright
  effectutate: put into force or operation; to bring about effects;

  are they words if they’re only in your head though? would that all of the neural snappings in my head, through habit/intentioin/motivation be trasnlated into langauge and wrtitten down--god writing is so beautiful and i’m finally beginning to see that beauty rather than just be kind of blindly weakly-magnetized toward it


  turn your phone off--man of renunciation--to think how ppl r rebuffed at the idea of someone else turning their phone off and not available for being-communicated-to for like an hour (Phone must be dead) but what if “turned his phone off to concentrate on something for more than an hour” ????

  o, so you didnt’ come out of an egg?
  also: how when i came down to detroit all i wanted to do was endless party and pleasure and watch movies and not create anything
  also how creations don’t seem real unless they’re shared on facebook or somewhere else--

chiaroscuro--art using big contrasts (black and white)
  luculus--roman general famous for giving lavish banquets
  wraith--ghost like thing seen shortly before or after death

  when was the last time that you sat around and contemplated a “problem” at length? also on “problem”: it doesn’t always mean like highschool administrative problem of cheating on a test, it means more identifying a knot in existence and working it out, almost.

  how money is related to one's ability to die--if i just had a bit more money i could keep him alive--

  rendezvous in harrisburg

  god what i would give to be doing the red-eye from l.a. to st. louis for 2 nights and then back to NYC indefinitely until another LaGuardia red-eye what would i have to do to get that life? what kind of job? what sort/set of reasons needed to travel beyond mere pleasure? how to get that much money? college?

  HF&E--human factors and ergonomics; study of designing equpiment and devices that fit the human body and its cognitive abilities

“the expert speaks” maybe only the experts can save us… probably bcoming an expert will get you money (literary, wordsmith, ideologizing)

  very thick glassed champagne flutes
  again with the 50 shades thing where Curtis is possible extricated from menial detective work from the studio exec.

  These sob-story-, one-more-chance-types were also the types that put Whitey Sorkin through hell in terms of emotionally, causing Whitey cluster headaches and terrible carnio-facial neuralgia, and at a certain point Sorkin used to start adding (to the delinquent skeet, the vigorish, and the interest) extra charged for his own required intake of Cafergot spansules and UV light and visits to enflied MA’s National CranioFacial Pain Foundation.


  and what could that, there, in the corner be? but a perfect pleather L-shaped sectional for a hastily formed yet still although highly erotic porn film? the L shape being perfect for many positions assuredly of course? but who doesn’t know that??? because it is a 101% lie that anyone has never not watched porn/masturbated in their life?
  visions of this plus cedeing my ill-fated friendship with hilary and puple dildo of gravity’s rainbow and Dreams and large laptop screen (patrics or soon-to-be-mine) and Slavoj zizek, and ripped hole sweatshirt and basically visions of LOTS of super intense and inspiring affectively and otherwise writing! basically…

  finishing infinite jest about 2 weeks after starting it ( a feat in its own ) for the second time (((( whoa )))) and then listening to dreams a la fleetwood mac wow T DU E ODESDRIGT FOR STORA SAKER! FAN! ALLVARLIGT TALAT!

  funny that it was w hilary that i maybe talked about renunciation most when really it was her growingly-ego-septicæmiaed presence that i needed to renounce--
  remember feeling like i was insane?
  <b>remember taking out a contact when you didn't have any in?</b>
  and admitting it to a group of ppl and someone had also done it
  is it not the best way to assuage one's sanity... to realize that others share the experience?

feeling lucky is almost always right, if `howdoi` didn't quite get you there

1. edit ur search engine settings to include a shortcut to i'm feeling lucky query

2. mine being `l <space> "query"`

3. read the resulting page and weep

my own experiences in debugging (to tears) and watching other developers is the immediate googling of a well-ish worded question will produce the intended result

_bonus tip: this is failsafe provided that you've clearly defined distinct steps you need to take & make it happen_

_double bonus: reading documentation_

_triple bonus: reading and then practicomg what u read in a sandbox_

_quadruple bonus: spaced repetition of 1-3_

tl;dr guessing / poking around in the dark / deleting everything has never worked and if it has it's infinitely less preferable to the ^ method

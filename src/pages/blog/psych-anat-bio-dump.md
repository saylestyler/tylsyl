**Avoid “dead eyes.”** A virtual character’s eyes are especially important. Using eye tracking, we found that users fixate on the eyes before they consider other features in assessing a character as real or not real.  This supports findings showing that people rate the realism and inconsistencies of human characters mainly based on the realism of the eyes. This also explains why skin makeup does not detract from animacy, in contrast with atypical eyes or the eyes of a dead person. This symptom of “dead eyes” is responsible for making artificial characters feel eerie and strange. Subtle features in the eyes communicate intentions, behavior, and well-being. These factors are essential in the assessment of and affinity for the depiction.

Research indicates that the uncanny valley triggers these feelings in humans to mark a potential threat or the risk of being infected with a transmissible disease.

_Use stylization and childish features for stylization._ Research in evolutionary aesthetics finds that humans respond positively to any aesthetic stimuli experienced as being conducive to survival and reproduction. That is why many designs, even if they are not human-like, can be aesthetically pleasing, as they may include features that suggest fitness. Participants in our studies and trained artists also often use childish features to increase affinity in their character designs. Children and infants elicit protective instincts and feelings of caretaking, which are the origin of social communities and mutual understanding. Humans have these feelings even toward beings not of their kind, which is potentially one reason why young animals, toys, and teddy bears are not in the uncanny valley. However, childish features should not be applied to a realistic adult, as they would be atypical. Features that evoke childhood in a positive way, such as snub noses and round head shapes, can also be deliberately used for stylization and to prevent the uncanny valley.

Symmetry and smooth skin have been found to be the most important factors in physical attractiveness. Additional desirable features for virtual faces include healthy and natural skin tones, natural and realistic proportions, clear gender cues, and volumetric and healthy-colored lips. Interestingly, participants did not seek perfection. Most of the participants reduced details on the skin, but not completely. This finding is in line with previous work showing that slight imperfections are still more appealing than perfectly smooth skin or facial symmetries.

## evolutionary dungeon designer

[Assessing aesthetic criteria in the evolutionary dungeon designer
](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3235810)

By upgrading the individual encoding system and the fitness evaluation in EDD's evolutionary algorithm, we present three techniques to preserve and account the designer's aesthetic criteria during the dungeon generation process: the capability of locking sections for preserving custom aesthetic structures, as well as the measurement of symmetry and similarity in the provided suggestions.

## supernatural shivers

from [Biological Templates for Musical Experience:](https://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Talks/2006/ISNM/abstract.html)

Fear to Pleasure

_International Symposium on the Neurobiology of Music_

The 18th century British philosopher, Edmund Burke, speculated that "sublime" aesthetic experiences (such as the experience of "awe") are related to the evoking of fear. Burke's speculations arose from informal observations, but modern neuroscience provides a more detailed and compelling account that is consistent with Burke's intuitions. This presentation discusses empirical research related to four major classes of emotional responses occasionally evoked by music: (1) frisson (characterized by chills, shivers, and piloerection), (2) laughter (characterized by what Provine has called "socialized panting"), (3) awe (characterized by gasping or breath-holding), and (4) weeping (characterized by tears, nasal congestion and laryngeal constriction). It is noted that these four responses closely resemble the four classic physiological patterns observed in vertebrate responses to fear: fight (defensive aggression), flight (withdrawl or escape), freeze (immobility) and submission (appeasement). An account is presented as to how musical passages might evoke such responses, and why the ensuing responses might be experienced as pleasurable.

## modalertness

from a [less wrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SmgMiErTGSTWm7CRW/rationality-drugs#ajS8getKFix6qbYPZ) w/r/t researching nootropics

I'd like to share one day's worth of experience with modafinil.
I noticed a huge difference in alertness. I was filled with an urge to be doing something every second. I don't believe I was more intelligent (some of the work I did that day turned out to be low quality) but I was much more productive. And happy. I felt like I was just "riding the day" -- that going through life, minute by minute, running errands, checking items off my to-do list, and seeing what happened next, was boundlessly fascinating.
I suspect that, at least for me, and maybe for others, most unhappiness is really fatigue, coupled with the guilt of not having accomplished much in a state of fatigue. Simply not being tired makes me deliriously happy. I am not surprised by the study that coffee reduces depression in women, though I know to be suspicious of medical study methodology. The symptoms of clinical depression look a lot like the symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation (fatigue, inability to concentrate, clumsiness, weight gain or weight loss, dramatic and irrational emotions). It's possible that some people with symptoms of depression are actually sleep deprived (or that a typical amount of sleep for a modern-day working or student life is too little for their biological needs.) I had a year when I thought I was losing my mind; in retrospect, it may have had something to do with getting no more than five hours of sleep a night.

## cognitive-load.srt

from [Measuring the impact of subtitles on cognitive load: eye tracking and dynamic audiovisual texts
](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2509331)

In educational design literature, it is often taken as fact that subtitles increase cognitive load (CL). This paper investigates this assumption experimentally by comparing various measures of CL when students watch a recorded academic lecture with or without subtitles. Since the measurement of cognitive load is by no means a simple matter, we first provide an overview of the different measurement techniques based on causality and objectivity. We measure CL by means of eye tracking (pupil dilation), electroencephalography (EEG), self-reported ratings of mental effort, frustration, comprehension effort and engagement, as well as performance measures (comprehension test).
Our findings seem to indicate that the subtitled condition in fact created lower CL in terms of percentage change in pupil diameter (PCPD) for the stimulus, approaching significance. In the subtitled condition PCPD also correlates significantly with participants' self-reported comprehension effort levels (their perception of how easy or difficult it was to understand the lecture). The EEG data, in turn, shows a significantly higher level of frustration for the unsubtitled condition. Negative emotional states could be caused by situations of higher CL (or cognitive overload) leading to learner frustration and dissatisfaction with learning activities and own performance \[16]. It could therefore be reasoned that participants had a higher CL in the absence of subtitles. The self-reported frustration levels correlate with the frustration measured by the EEG as well as the self-reported engagement levels for the subtitled group. We also found a significant correlation between the self-reported engagement levels and both the short- and long term comprehension for the unsubtitled condition but not for the subtitled condition. There was no significant difference in either short-term or long-term performance measures between the two groups, which seems to suggest that subtitles at the very least, do not result in cognitive overload.

## hug yrself

from [how to hug yourself](https://rybakov.com/essay/how_to_hug_yourself/)

Brad Sagarin, Ph.D., writes regarding BDSM:

The results revealed that both bottoms and tops entered altered states of consciousness, but they entered different altered states. Bottoms entered an altered state called “transient hypofrontality” (Dietrich, 2003), which is associated with reductions in pain, feelings of floating, feelings of peacefulness, feelings of living in the here and now and time distortions. Tops, in contrast, entered the altered state known as “flow” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991), which is associated with focused attention, a loss of self-consciousness and optimal performance of a task. We believe that these pleasurable altered states of consciousness might be one of the motivations that people have for engaging in BDSM activities.
_Hugging is an experience of mutual vulnerability and reciprocal immobilization, as each hugger is restricting the other while being restricted themselves._

## somatics

Given that empathy is a core principle in human-centered design approaches, it makes sense to enhance empathy with others through empathizing with oneself. This understanding is resonant with Eastern traditions of self-cultivation, which lead to self-knowledge and an egoless state of being, going beyond empathy to compassion [7].

# `/$/,/g` add to end of every line

`:%s/$/,/` will add a comma 									to, 
<br/>											the, 
<br/>											end, 
<br/>											of, 
<br/>											every,
<br/>
line,

(vim) do a subset of lines instead of the whole file, specify them in place of the %.

One way is to do a visual select and then type the :. It will fill in :'<,'> for you, then you type the rest of it (Notice you only need to add s/$/,/)

`:'<,'>s/$/,/`

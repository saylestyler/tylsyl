description: getting my mind blown by rust's cargo

# ok wowwie 

I was writing some companion notes as I was following along with _the_ rust book. I found myself appending screenshot after progressively wowwier screenshot as I played around with `cargo doc --open`

# bg

cargo = rust's build tool & package manager

gives you the following commands

`cargo build`
`cargo test`
`cargo doc` (!)
`cargo run` (compiles & runs in one step)
`cargo publish` (publishes to <crates.io>)

for global installation of fmt & linting tools:

`rustup component add rustfmt
; rustup component add clippy`

# where yours truli was woo'd

in the lil starter project I used the `rand` random number generator

```rs
use rand::Rng

// etc 



```

`cargo doc --open` will build docs provided by all ur local dependencies; if u are using `rand::Rng`, you can call the former and click on `rand` to find out more functionality contained in the crate

then clicking on the methods will reveal trait implementations, methods, etc.

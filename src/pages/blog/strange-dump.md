The hour was 3:30am and I found meself looking at Google's flutter's [flutter-clock](flutter.dev/clock) contest rules and regulations. I had/have absolutely zero desire to do this, but I read the rules w/ detached ecstasy in my insomnia-y stupor.

Note the real weird rule: 

> Persons from the following embargoed countries or regions should not submit entries and will not be considered eligible for the contest, including exclusion from judging and prizes: Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Sudan.

Who knew? 

#TODO: add more oddities, lol

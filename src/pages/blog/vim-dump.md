## saving

```vim
" Use qq in insert and command mode to Esc and to exit when in normal mode
inoremap qq <Esc>
cnoremap qq <Esc>
nnoremap qq :q<cr>
nnoremap q1 :q!<cr>

" Use qs to save while in insert mode
inoremap qs <Esc>:w<cr>a
```

## :h vim

i went weeks hitting ctrl + p which search _only node modules_ before 
hitting `:h CtrlP` where i learned how to set the custom ignore paths :~)

```vim
:h CtrlP

You can use Vim's |'wildignore'| to exclude files and directories from the
results.
Examples: >
  " Excluding version control directories
  set wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*        " Linux/MacOSX
  set wildignore+=*\\.git\\*,*\\.hg\\*,*\\.svn\\*  " Windows ('noshellslash')
```

## vim !$

or any command supplied w/ last bit of previous output

## vim.fandom.co.uk.biz.gov 

<https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki>

or any url = edit the html of said page

## r!

execute a command and print results under cursor

```vim
:r! echo $PATH
```

## vim frozen?

1. review `autocmd`s like autocmd BufWritePre * %s/\s\+$//e`
2. ctrl+c

## jump to last known cursor position / rename file

[src](https://github.com/harlow/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/functions/last_cursor_position.vim)

```vim
augroup vimrcEx
  au!

  autocmd FileType text setlocal textwidth=78

  autocmd BufReadPost *
    \ if line("'\"") > 0 && line("'\"") <= line("$") |
    \   exe "normal g`\"" |
    \ endif
augroup END

function! RenameFile()
    let old_name = expand('%')
    let new_name = input('New file name: ', expand('%'), 'file')
    if new_name != '' && new_name != old_name
        exec ':saveas ' . new_name
        exec ':silent !rm ' . old_name
        redraw!
    endif
endfunction

map <leader>n :call RenameFile()<cr>
```

## encrypt a file w/ a key

`:X`

enter a key

`:wq!`

open the file, re-enter the key

## search word beneath cursor in current dir

... and navigate 2 the first result... (in a new buffer!)

`nnoremap <F5> :grep <C-R><C-W> *<CR>`

[src](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Mapping_keys_in_Vim_-_Tutorial_%28Part_1%29)

## plugin overload?

`vim --noplugin`

## <3 the current setup?

`:mk copy-of-current-settings.vim`

```vim
copy-of-current-settings.vim

if &cp | set nocp | endif
let s:cpo_save=&cpo
set cpo&vim
imap <Nul> <C-Space>
inoremap <expr> <Up> pumvisible() ? "\" : "\<Up>"
inoremap <expr> <Down> pumvisible() ? "\" : "\<Down>"
inoremap <expr> <S-Tab> pumvisible() ? "\" : "\<S-Tab>"
inoremap <silent> <Plug>NERDCommenterInsert  <BS>:call NERDComment('i', "insert")
inoremap <silent> <expr> <Plug>delimitMateS-BS delimitMate#WithinEmptyPair() ? "\<Del>" : "\<S-BS>"
inoremap <silent> <Plug>delimitMateBS =delimitMate#BS()
inoremap <silent> <C-Tab> =UltiSnips#ListSnippets()
" etc
```

## what CTRL-x does?

`:h ctrl-x`

## delete rest of line

instead of `d $` use `C`

## ctrl+p = best file explorer

don't use nnn, vifm, ranger, lynx etc.

## marks & jumps

`ms` = set a mark @ spot under cursor
`s` = go back 2 ms

(quicker: use c-i <tab> + c-o)

```vim
CTRL-O      Go to [count] Older cursor position in jump list

<Tab>   or          *CTRL-I* *<Tab>*

CTRL-I      Go to [count] newer cursor position in jump list
```

## `set guifont=*`

brings up font requester!

Definitions
UNBOUND - this key is not normally bound to any vi command
word - a lower-case word ("w", "b", "e" commands) is defined by a consecutive string of letters, numbers, or underscore, or a consecutive string of characters that is not any of {letters, numbers, underscore, whitespace}
Word - an upper-case word ("W", "B", "E" commands) is a consecutive sequence of non-whitespace.
sentence
paragraph
cursor motion command - any command which positions the cursor is ok here, including the use of numeric prefixes. In addition, a repeat of the edit command usually means to apply to the entire current line. For example, "<<" means shift current line left; "cc" means replace entire current line; and "dd" means delete entire current line.
```
